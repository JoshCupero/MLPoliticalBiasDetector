New York Times,Elon Musk Is Making Republicans Sweat and Giving Democrats a New Target,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-politics.html,"Elon Musk’s Influence Advertisement Supported by His unusual governing arrangement with President Trump is opening Republicans up to being yoked politically to Mr. Musk, who polls show is broadly unpopular. By Jess Bidgood and Lisa Lerer He held court in the Oval Office in a T-shirt and blazer with a child clinging to his shoulders. He takes private meetings on Capitol Hill, offering his phone number for senators to voice their complaints, as if they are his constituents. And last month, he brandished a chain saw as he promised to cut spending, to rapturous cheers from conservative activists. Seven weeks into President Trump’s second administration, Elon Musk has not just upended the government. His omnipresence in Washington has also swiftly become an unpredictable factor that could reshape politics across the country. Already, the billionaire’s signature slash-and-burn style and showy spending cuts have reverberated far beyond the Capitol, making even lawmakers from deep-red states begin to sweat. He has shown a willingness to shape elections directly, both by spending locally and by threatening to wield his fortune to stifle dissent within the Republican Party. And he has given a glimmer of hope to Democrats in search of a message they can use against Mr. Trump, playing a starring role in new advertising for their candidates and by several of the party’s major campaign arms. Democratic operatives gleefully swap private polling suggesting Mr. Musk could prove a serious liability for the president. While many presidents have relied on family members or close friends as advisers, never before has the country seen an unelected billionaire and newcomer to electoral politics gain such a powerful and prominent perch in the White House.

New York Times,‘You Can’t Pin Him Down’: Trump’s Contradictions Are His Ultimate Cover,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/us/politics/trump-third-term-gaza-contradictions.html,"Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by News Analysis President Trump’s shifting positions and outright lies have presented the American public with dueling narratives at every turn. By Erica L. Green Erica L. Green covers the White House. She reported from Washington. What does President Trump really believe? Does he want to run for a third term, or is that just a joke? Does he intend to seize control of Gaza and expel millions of Palestinians, or is that just a suggestion? Is Black History Month a waste of time and money, or worth a lavish celebration at the White House? Anyone looking for definitive answers will have a hard time finding them. Since storming back into office, Mr. Trump has used a dizzying rhetorical tactic of shifting positions like quicksand, muddying his messages and contradicting himself, sometimes in the same day. The inconsistencies have presented the American public with dueling narratives at every turn, allowing people to pick and choose what they want to believe about the president’s intentions. Mr. Trump has long dealt in distortions and lies, including in his first term. But as he executes a much more aggressive agenda at home and abroad, his contradictions have become more brazen and more pronounced. “He says so much, you can’t really pin him down,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a Princeton history professor and editor of a book of essays about Mr. Trump’s first term. “The point isn’t to have a contradiction, the point is to have cover.” “The reality of our modern information world is that you can pick and choose what you want to believe,” Mr. Zelizer added. “He instinctively knows that.” Within hours of taking office, Mr. Trump pardoned Jan. 6 rioters who assaulted Capitol Police officers, a move that clashed with his professed support for law enforcement.

 February 24, 2025 • In 2015, the NFL agreed to an uncapped settlement to pay former players diagnosed with brain disease. The agreement came after players sued the league for covering what it knew about the links between brain disease and football. But who's gotten paid and how much is affected by their race. On the final episode of our series on race and football, we speak with Will Hobson, investigative sports reporter at The Washington Post.

 February 12, 2025 • How the criminal legal system considers who is and isn't Native, and what that means for the Black people who are members of tribal nations. This reporting is part of an audio documentary from Audible called Tribal Justice: The Struggle for Black Rights on Native Land. February 10, 2025 • The way football is played and who plays it — from the pee-wees to the pros — tells us so much about race, labor and power in the United States. In a conversation with cultural anthropologist Tracie Canada we explore how starting from young ages, Black players are nudged towards more physically taxing positions that require more strength, athleticism, speed. That affects who gets injured, how they're cared for and how they get paid. by

Now a subset of the manosphere aimed at Black men is exposing cracks in Black voters' steadfast support of Democrats.

Washington Times,No end in sight: One year into Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine,https://www.washingtontimes.com/specials/no-end-putin-war-ukraine/,"The unthinkable has become the routine — a shooting war with tanks, trenches, drones and vast waves of refugees playing out in the heart of Europe. Russia’s military invasion of its neighbor is churning into its second year with growing fears that an imminent escalation could lead to a direct clash with NATO and decades of conflict pitting the Kremlin and its allies against the U.S. and Western-aligned democracies around the world. To mark the anniversary of the day Russian forces first poured into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Washington Times correspondents Guy Taylor and Ben Wolfgang analyze the state of the war and go inside the mindset of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is pumping more troops and equipment into the war while attempting to break Ukraine’s morale with increased attacks on civil targets. The three-day series examines how the world has changed in the past 12 months and how much is riding on the months to come, including the cutthroat internal political dynamics in Moscow, the ability of Ukraine’s government and armed forces to hold out against a bigger, better-armed adversary, the staying power of U.S. and European aid flows into Ukraine, and the potential impacts of imminent deliveries of German and American battle tanks. Beyond the hard numbers and ruined lives, the biggest mystery facing Ukraine, the U.S. and the world isn't quantitative but psychological: What does Russian President Vladimir Putin want and how far is he prepared to go to get it? Prominent right-wing Russian nationalists have seen their influence and public profiles rise over the past year to a point where they appear poised to shape the country's future. The year-old Russian invasion of Ukraine has shaken the foundations of a post-Cold War order that has held sway for three decades, sparking new global unease over the prospect of nuclear war, rocking long-established diplomatic and political norms, and aligning the world's top autocracies in unsettling new ways. It's a familiar pattern that has played out throughout the year-old Russia-Ukraine war. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has seen a lot in the year since Russian forces crossed over the border into his country -- and very little of it has gone the way the experts predicted. Russian President Vladimir Putin is betting that U.S. and Western European political and societal resolve to back Kyiv will soon break down so that his military can proceed with its dismemberment of Ukraine, the top European Union diplomat in Washington warned in an interview. The contrast could not have been more stark -- or the timing more striking.",unthinkable become routine shooting war tank trench drone vast wave refugee playing heart europe russia military invasion neighbor churning second year growing fear imminent escalation could lead direct clash nato decade conflict pitting kremlin ally western aligned democracy around world mark anniversary day russian force first poured ukraine february washington time correspondent guy taylor ben wolfgang analyze state war go inside mindset russian president vladimir putin pumping troop equipment war attempting break ukraine morale increased attack civil target three day series examines world changed past month much riding month come including cutthroat internal political dynamic moscow ability ukraine government armed force hold bigger better armed adversary staying power european aid flow ukraine potential impact imminent delivery german american battle tank beyond hard number ruined life biggest mystery facing ukraine world quantitative psychological russian president vladimir putin want far prepared go get prominent right wing russian nationalist seen influence public profile rise past year point appear poised shape country future year old russian invasion ukraine shaken foundation post cold war order held sway three decade sparking new global unease prospect nuclear war rocking long established diplomatic political norm aligning world top autocracy unsettling new way familiar pattern played throughout year old russia ukraine war ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov seen lot year since russian force crossed border country little gone way expert predicted russian president vladimir putin betting western european political societal resolve back kyiv soon break military proceed dismemberment ukraine top european union diplomat washington warned interview contrast could stark timing striking,end sight one year vladimir putin war ukraine,Far Right,231.739,Authoritarian,89.76227,Authoritarian Far Right

Washington Post,POLITICS,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/,"Democrats are seeking cohesion in their opposition to President Donald Trump and a message that resonates with voters. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2024, says the party’s campaign strategy was too cautious and didn’t resonate with voters.  With less than a week to go before a March 14 shutdown deadline, it is not clear if Republicans have the votes to pass the continuing resolution unveiled Saturday. Outside groups from across the ideological spectrum have spent decades documenting questionable government spending. The losses at two Native American schools were part of the Trump administration’s purge of federal workers. A partial reversal has done little to allay fears. Political gravity does apply to Trump after all, it seems. His move to dismantle the Education Department is merely the latest example of initiatives that Americans seem to strongly oppose. They increasingly support a negotiated end to the war and even territorial concessions to Russia — but not necessarily like this. Trump set a record and pleaded for patience on his tariffs, while Democrats tried a number of different protests. The vice president denied that his comment about a “random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years” was aimed at Britain and France. Trump’s remarks represent a shift for the president, who in 2018 withdrew the United States from a nuclear deal with Iran. The president had vowed to eliminate the century-old practice of “springing forward” and “falling back” but is now acknowledging the complicated politics. Vice President JD Vance is the obvious and prohibitive frontrunner, but here’s who else could be in the mix. The latest news on President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and the new Congress. A rundown of Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises and where they stand. The Stand Up for Science rallies are a response to the Trump administration’s actions, which critics see as a threat to scientific progress. Paul Clement, a former solicitor general, was asked by U.S. Judge Dale Ho to weigh in on the Justice Dept.’s controversial request to dismiss the Adams case. Keep tabs on the Trump administration’s daily actions and executive orders, and follow the stories that are most important to you. “Anybody” would step up the attack, Trump said of Russia’s first major missile assault on Ukraine since the U.S. paused intelligence sharing with the embattled country. Judge Amir H. Ali set a noon Friday deadline for the Trump administration and aid organizations to clarify how much more the groups are owed. Follow President-elect Trump’s progress filling over 800 positions, among about 1,300 that require Senate confirmation, in this tracker from The Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service. The International Republican Institute’s furloughed staffers feel betrayed by former board member Marco Rubio. Members of the second largest federal union lobbied Congress this week, promoting civil service protections and fighting mass firings.  Outside watchdogs and analysts say Trump and Musk are using overly broad claims of fraud to build political support for their plans. The show of force by Trump administration officials and federal law enforcement resulted in a frantic and “traumatizing” scene, several officials of the aid agency said, and sparked a lawsuit from its leader.",democrat seeking cohesion opposition president donald trump message resonates voter tim walz democratic vice presidential nominee say party campaign strategy cautious resonate voter less week go march shutdown deadline clear republican vote pas continuing resolution unveiled saturday outside group across ideological spectrum spent decade documenting questionable government spending loss two native american school part trump administration purge federal worker partial reversal done little allay fear political gravity apply trump seems move dismantle education department merely latest example initiative american seem strongly oppose increasingly support negotiated end war even territorial concession russia necessarily like trump set record pleaded patience tariff democrat tried number different protest vice president denied comment random country fought war year aimed britain france trump remark represent shift president withdrew united state nuclear deal iran president vowed eliminate century old practice springing forward falling back acknowledging complicated politics vice president jd vance obvious prohibitive frontrunner else could mix latest news president donald trump return white house new congress rundown donald trump biggest campaign promise stand stand science rally response trump administration action critic see threat scientific progress paul clement former solicitor general asked judge dale ho weigh justice dept controversial request dismiss adam case keep tab trump administration daily action executive order follow story important anybody would step attack trump said russia first major missile assault ukraine since paused intelligence sharing embattled country judge amir ali set noon friday deadline trump administration aid organization clarify much group owed follow president elect trump progress filling position among require senate confirmation tracker washington post partnership public service international republican institute furloughed staffer feel betrayed former board member marco rubio member second largest federal union lobbied congress week promoting civil service protection fighting mass firing outside watchdog analyst say trump musk using overly broad claim fraud build political support plan show force trump administration official federal law enforcement resulted frantic traumatizing scene several official aid agency said sparked lawsuit leader,politics,Right,117.48593,Authoritarian,102.65534,Authoritarian Right

Washington Post,THE FIX,https://www.washingtonpost.com/the-fix/?itid=sf_politics_subnav,"Politics Vice President JD Vance is the obvious and prohibitive frontrunner, but here’s who else could be in the mix. Political gravity does apply to Trump after all, it seems. His move to dismantle the Education Department is merely the latest example of initiatives that Americans seem to strongly oppose. They increasingly support a negotiated end to the war and even territorial concessions to Russia — but not necessarily like this. Trump set a record and pleaded for patience on his tariffs, while Democrats tried a number of different protests. The vice president denied that his comment about a “random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years” was aimed at Britain and France. Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico are due to start Tuesday, but the polling and economic dynamics point to political peril. It’s clear that President Donald Trump is pressuring Ukraine to make concessions. But Americans aren’t sold on giving up territory, and many are concerned about Russia’s threat. The key moments in a series of heated exchanges, and what it all means. It’s happened repeatedly in recent days, and Trump has sometimes taken exception. Anecdotes aside, polls show little sign of significant Trump voter backlash. But some warning signs of discontent loom. It’s the latest episode of Trump’s base quickly adopting his posture, despite the evidence. Their just-passed budget proposal pretty clearly requires cutting Medicaid, and that’s a big political problem. Martin, a Trump nominee for U.S. attorney, has blurred the line between prosecutor and political activist. His confirmation process will be telling. As their Republican colleagues avoid criticizing Trump like the plague, a handful have begun using some pretty strong words. Elon Musk’s threat to federal employees is the latest episode to call into question the White House’s downplaying of his authority. Provocative messages have become central to the Trump team’s political efforts, inviting everyone to guess what’s a joke and what’s not. New polling shows Trump’s approval ratings declining — and a number of major warning signs appearing. On the first big foreign policy test of the GOP’s obeisance to Trump, some lawmakers are obliquely distancing themselves from Trump. Donald Trump has long resisted criticizing Vladimir Putin, but now he’s apparently more than happy to do so with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.",politics vice president jd vance obvious prohibitive frontrunner else could mix political gravity apply trump seems move dismantle education department merely latest example initiative american seem strongly oppose increasingly support negotiated end war even territorial concession russia necessarily like trump set record pleaded patience tariff democrat tried number different protest vice president denied comment random country fought war year aimed britain france trump tariff canada mexico due start tuesday polling economic dynamic point political peril clear president donald trump pressuring ukraine make concession american sold giving territory many concerned russia threat key moment series heated exchange mean happened repeatedly recent day trump sometimes taken exception anecdote aside poll show little sign significant trump voter backlash warning sign discontent loom latest episode trump base quickly adopting posture despite evidence passed budget proposal pretty clearly requires cutting medicaid big political problem martin trump nominee attorney blurred line prosecutor political activist confirmation process telling republican colleague avoid criticizing trump like plague handful begun using pretty strong word elon musk threat federal employee latest episode call question white house downplaying authority provocative message become central trump team political effort inviting everyone guess joke new polling show trump approval rating declining number major warning sign appearing first big foreign policy test gop obeisance trump lawmaker obliquely distancing trump donald trump long resisted criticizing vladimir putin apparently happy ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky,fix,Right,142.41101,Moderate,7.7363544,Moderate Right

The Pew survey paints a picture of America that is more secular, particularly among young people, but remains a place where religious views closely align with politics. Reviews from Americans on President Donald Trump’s second term are mixed to negative, and 57 percent say he has exceeded his authority since taking office. Dig into all the numbers in our polls, look at demographic groups and examine trends over time. A slim majority of Maryland voters say they are open to a plan to delay an increase in planning time for teachers, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll. The new law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will overhaul a 2012 county law on plastic and paper bag use. County officials said that law was poorly implemented. Maryland residents support Gov. Wes Moore’s plan to raise taxes on the wealthy, but they’re not enthusiastic about a 75-cent delivery fee.  Two dozen Americans share their thoughts on Trump’s second presidential inauguration  with The Post. One-third of swing-state voters who voted for Trump replied in an open-ended question that they voted for him because of the economy. They are much less worried, though, about Trump trying to become a dictator. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll finds Americans split on whether Trump will try to rule as a dictator, but confident any effort would be blocked.

Washington Post,Trump’s speech showed Democrats at low ebb. A comeback will take work.,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/09/democrats-seek-comeback-message/,"Democrats are seeking cohesion in their opposition to President Donald Trump and a message that resonates with voters. The Democrats showed last week that presidential addresses to Congress are no place to formulate a resistance. Almost everything they did during President Donald Trump’s appearance highlighted weakness rather than strength. They had not one strategy but several. The sum was less than the parts. Many Democrats came away worried that their party is even weaker than it appeared after Trump’s victory in November, and for now, Democrats might be left to hope that Trump and the Republicans will make enough mistakes to offer them a way back. But that is only one part of a comeback strategy if Democrats are to become broadly competitive. The Democrats were handcuffed from the start Tuesday night as they sought to project the right amount of opposition. Too boisterous and unruly in their disagreements and they would embarrass themselves, playing into Trump’s hands and highlighting their powerlessness. Too passive and they would further anger their demoralized base that is looking for a spark of life from the leadership of the party. They were passive, yes, while trying to project mild resistance. In the House chamber, some Democrats held up ping-pong-size paddles with messages of opposition, discreet as to be ineffective. Some commentators likened them to a group of bidders at an art auction. Some women Democratic lawmakers were dressed in pink to protest Trump policies they say will hurt women and families. It was a sign of solidarity, but given how many people had filled the chamber, the symbolism by a relatively few probably was lost on those watching from home. The most dramatic moment came when Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) stood up and shook his cane at the president, charging that Trump has no mandate to make cuts in Medicaid. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) demanded that he cease and desist, warning Green that he could be removed if he persisted. Green did persist and eventually was ushered out. On Thursday, he was censured by the House. Ten Democrats voted with the Republicans. Green’s protest was hardly the first such outburst during a presidential address to Congress. As President Barack Obama was speaking to a joint session about health care in September 2009, Rep. Joe Wilson (R-South Carolina) shouted out, “You lie.” His eruption was seen as a scandal, a breach of congressional decorum that shocked members of both parties. Wilson was condemned, and he apologized to Obama. But grassroots Republicans loved him for it. A week later, Politico carried a story with the headline “Joe Wilson: Right-wing folk hero.” With that Wilson moment, a descent had begun and has spiraled downward ever since. Year by year, these presidential addresses to Congress have been transformed from (sometimes boring) speechmaking to now Trump’s gaudy showmanship. A year ago, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) repeatedly heckled President Joe Biden as he delivered his final State of the Union address. Biden so effectively parried her taunts and those of others that he came out a winner. Private concerns among Democrats about his physical and mental decline gave way to public comments about his energy and quick  ripostes. By summer, however, he was out of the presidential race, indicative of the lack of staying power from such events. By this summer, things may look worse for Trump and better for Democrats. On Tuesday, Trump effectively baited the Democrats into quiescence during the opening moments of his speech. They were so immobilized that they could not even respond with applause to a feel-good moment, when a 13-year-old cancer survivor named DJ Daniel, who has dreamed of becoming a police officer, was made an honorary member of the Secret Service and spontaneously embraced Sean Curran, the new director of the Secret Service. Individual Democratic elected officials have adopted different strategies for dealing with Trump. Sen. Chris Murphy (Connecticut) has been aggressive in calling out the president and his policies. So too has Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois. Some Democrats have indicated a desire to find common ground with the administration when possible. But there is no consensus yet on the best approach. The state of the Democrats is made worse by the absence of a leader who enjoys national reach and recognition. Without a presidential nominee, that problem will prevail. Were Nancy Pelosi still the House speaker, many grassroots Democrats might look to her to lead the opposition. Neither House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (New York) nor Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (New York) has been able to fill that role. The road ahead will come in cycles, starting with the 2026 midterm election, followed by the 2028 presidential election. Beyond that, more questions will emerge about the party’s longer-term revival and whether  it can become more competitive in more places. Trump and the Republicans could play into the Democrats’ hands in the near term. The Trump team risks overinterpreting the mandate from the November election. The president’s leadership has been bold but also erratic: tariffs on and tariffs off, federal workers fired and rehired, budget savings overstated, Cabinet officers rebelling against Elon Musk. Economic uncertainty has pushed the markets down. All this has begun to affect the president’s standing, and his decision to mildly rein in Musk a few days ago was a sign of his concerns. Another political obstacle for the GOP will come as Congress moves further into budget season. House Republicans have adopted a plan that would require significant cuts to Medicaid. Republican leaders know the dangers. Either they throttle back and fall short of their promises to cut spending, or they go ahead and possibly inflict significant pain on Medicaid recipients; on the states, which share the costs; and ultimately on Trump and the party as a whole. Republicans may have forgotten the budget fight during the Clinton administration that led to a government shutdown in 1995-1996. Prodded by House Speaker Newt Gingrich (Georgia), Republicans wanted to reduce the size of government. Their plan included cuts in the projected growth of Medicare and Medicaid as well as other programs. Clinton resisted and won the political argument. That moment began Clinton’s comeback after Republicans had captured the House in 1994 for the first time in 40 years. The 2026 midterm will be shaped by this coming budget battle and by the success or failure of Trump’s other initiatives. Democrats will need an energized base, but success in 2026 won’t necessarily mean the party has been restored to good health. A victory could be little more than a reflection that midterm elections are more about the president and less about the opposition, and of the constant shifting in the balance of power in the House that has been the norm for almost two decades. The 2028 presidential election will offer Democrats still another opportunity to show what they learned from defeat last year. Parties are defined by their presidential nominees — and successful nominees, those who survive the grueling primary process and go on to win the White House, redefine their party. Clinton did that in 1992. Obama did it in 2008, though in a less definitive way. No one can say who will emerge to lead the Democrats in 2028. At this point in the 2008 cycle, Obama was already a rock star in the party and Hillary Clinton was nationally known and considered part of the best brand in the Democratic Party. At this point in the 1992 cycle, if Bill Clinton was known nationally it was more for delivering a too-long nominating speech at the 1988 convention. But Clinton was doing the intellectual work to reshape the Democrats into a post-Great Society party and developing a message to reflect that, though he experienced some bruising intraparty battles to get there. Today’s Democrats will have to confront culture war issues that have hurt them while developing an economic message that resonates with working-class voters who have shifted to the GOP. Notably, a few days ago, California Gov. Gavin Newsom came out against transgender athletes participating in women’s and girls’ sports, almost four months after Rep. Seth Moulton (Massachusetts) made a similar statement. Democratic strategists, wealthy donors and elected officials are at work trying to understand better the state the party is in. The party’s opposition to Trump currently lacks cohesion or consensus, but a comeback will not be won in the next 90 or 180 days regardless. It will take debate, disagreement and some unforeseen events before it’s clear whether Democrats are finding the formula. Follow live updates on the Trump administration. We’re tracking President Donald Trump’s actions by day, his progress on campaign promises, and legal challenges to his executive orders and actions. Trump’s speech: Trump addressed a joint session of Congress 43 days after his inauguration, outlining a message of defiant optimism for those who support him and gloomy despair for those who don’t.

Breitbart,Border / Cartel Chronicles,https://www.breitbart.com/border/,"A member of Mexico’s National Guard pleaded guilty to using his position to help a car theft ring that was supplying vehicles from Texas to the Gulf Cartel in Mexico. A member of Mexico’s National Guard pleaded guilty to using his position to help a car theft ring that was supplying vehicles from Texas to the Gulf Cartel in Mexico. Un miembro de la Guardia Nacional de México se declaró culpable de usar su posición para ayudar a una red de robo de autos que suministraba vehículos al Cártel del Golfo en México. A man from Laredo, Texas, is under arrest after Texas Department of Public Safety troopers allegedly caught him smuggling illegal aliens. The arrest followed a dangerous high-speed pursuit through a residential neighborhood near the state’s border with Mexico. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents carried out a workplace enforcement operation on Houston’s north side, leading to the arrest of 20 undocumented workers. The workers were taken to the Montgomery County Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. Jorge Antonio Velez-Lopez, a 69-year-old native of Colombia and former archdiocese priest, received a one-year federal prison sentence for passport fraud. Velez-Lopez, a convicted child molester, was naturalized by the court — losing his United States citizenship — and ordered removed from the U.S. to Colombia. Students participating in Pro-Hamas demonstrations on college campuses who are non-immigrant visa holders have been put on notice that they will face deportation by the Trump administration. Firming up a similar message from President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whose department issues the visas required to study in the United States, made clear that foreign students who support terrorist organizations will face severe consequences. Police officials in Texas say they have arrested one of the suspected killers of a popular Fort Worth, Texas, rapper known as G$ Lil Ronnie (Ronnie Sibley) and his five-year-old daughter. The arrest occurred at a Chevron station in Livingston on U.S. Highway 59 and Highway 190. Prison officials in Philadelphia continue to ignore U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) immigration detainers, forcing officers to confront dangerous criminal illegal alien offenders in uncontrolled prison and jail parking lots. Prisoner transfers between law enforcement agencies routinely happen inside the controlled jail environment so officers can safely assume inmate custody. A border wall upgrade construction project canceled by President Joe Biden is back underway in the Texas Rio Grande Valley. Authorities in Mexico have remained tight-lipped about the reason behind the kidnapping, torture, and dismemberment of nine students who were traveling through Mexico to a beach town in southern Mexico. The mass killing comes as the Trump Administration imposed a series of tariffs on Mexico as a punitive measure for the “intolerable relationship” between Mexico’s government and drug cartels. Las autoridades en México han guardado silencio sobre el motivo del secuestro, tortura y desmembramiento de 9 estudiantes que viajaban por carretera hacia una ciudad costera en el sur de México. El  cruento asesinato e produce en un momento en que la Administración de Trump ha impuesto una serie de aranceles a México como medida punitiva por la “relación intolerable” entre el gobierno de ese país y los cárteles de la droga. President Donald Trump touted the success of his new administration’s border security and immigration policies during a Tuesday-night speech to a joint session of Congress. The president summed up the dramatic shift in migrant border encounter numbers, saying simply, “All we really needed was a new president.” Vice President JD Vance and several other administration officials will tour the Texas border city of Eagle Pass on Wednesday. The trip follows Tuesday night’s historic speech to a joint session of Congress, during which President Donald Trump proudly celebrated his administration’s success in reducing migrant encounters at the southern border by 94 percent. According to a source within U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the massive soft-sided migrant processing centers in several Texas border cities have been ordered to shut down immediately. The source, not authorized to speak to the media, says the soft-sided processing centers located in Eagle Pass, Laredo, and the Texas Rio Grande Valley will be dismantled due to the cancellation of “Catch and Release” and the slowing of illegal border crossings under the Trump administration. A Venezuelan national and suspected member of the violent Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang is being charged by federal prosecutors with possessing a firearm as an illegal alien. According to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, the suspect entered the United States in Texas using the Biden administration’s now-disabled CBP-One smartphone asylum application to enter the United States in 2023. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum publicly blamed Americans struggling with addiction as the cause of her country facing a new set of tariffs from the Trump administration. She chose to blame victims of cartel drug trafficking rather than ruthless drug lords who enjoy the protection of Mexico’s government. Border Patrol agents and their law enforcement partners have managed to seize and prevent more than $25 million in cocaine from reaching the interior of the United States during the past seven days. The latest seizure, which occurred on Thursday near San Clemente, California, was nabbed after a Border Patrol K-9 unit sniffed out the illicit substance hidden in trash bags located in the trunk of a vehicle. The Mexican government is pushing a “Tough on Cartels” propaganda operation through U.S. media outlets while simultaneously protecting some of the country’s top, currently active, cartel bosses. Breitbart Texas reported extensively on the Mexican government’s exaggerations and half-truths about enforcement actions. Breitbart articles highlighted Mexico’s continued protection of leaders like the Cartel Jalisco New Generation boss, “El Mencho.” The New York Times fell for this PR strategy in a recent article, claiming cartels are in fear. A labor union representing farm workers that for more than a decade begged the Border Patrol to enforce immigration laws is now part of a lawsuit against the Border Patrol for doing just that. The lawsuit, filed by the United Farm Workers (UFW) and five Kern County residents, seeks to stop the Border Patrol from future enforcement actions that stop, arrest, and remove “community members” from the country. A Texas Department of Public Safety brush team arrested five illegal alien gotaways after tracking them for miles on ranches located 50 miles north of the Mexican Border. The brush team turned the five Mexican nationals over to Border Patrol agents for entry into removal proceedings. A social media post by the Chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, Michael W. Banks, shows February apprehensions to be a record low for the Agency. Banks’s post reveals the startling impact of the Trump presidency on illegal migration to the United States in the 42 days since assuming office. Mexico’s top security officials revealed that they had information that some of the 28 top cartel drug lords extradited to U.S. authorities last week could have been released by corrupt judges. The historic move occurred on the same day that Mexico’s security cabinet traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with some U.S. cabinet, military, and law enforcement officials. Under orders from the Trump administration, the Pentagon is deploying 3,000 more troops and armored Stryker vehicles to the U.S. border with Mexico.  The orders expand current operations and to “seal the border and protect the territorial integrity of the United States,” officials said. Border Patrol agents in Texas teamed up with sheriff’s deputies in two counties, leading to the seizure of more than a half-million dollars in cash. The occupants of the vehicle face state charges related to cash smuggling. Forty years after the kidnapping, torture, and brutal murder of DEA Agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena, one of the men responsible for his death finally did a perp walk as he got out of a plane into the waiting hands of U.S. agents. The criminal spent decades in Mexico under the protection of top government officials. Mexico extradited 29 bosses from cartels designated by the Trump administration as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO) on Thursday. Included in the list is the accused assassin of a cartel attorney in Dallas who U.S. authorities have wanted for 13 years. The first known image of Jose Rodolfo Villarreal-Hernandez — “El Gato” — was first revealed by Breitbart Texas. In an apparent attempt to appease U.S. officials who have been pushing for tariffs and punitive measures against Mexico for their alleged role in protecting drug cartels, that country’s authorities confirmed the extradition of 29 criminals wanted by the U.S. Department of Justice. These include a top drug boss behind the 1985 murder of DEA Agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena, the two supreme leaders of Los Zetas Cartel, and the brother of the supreme leader of Cartel Jalisco New Generation. Mexican authorities extradited the two supreme leaders of Los Zetas just hours before that country’s security cabinet was set to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his staff. Mexican migrants illegally present in the United States are being deported to the southernmost border of Mexico, according to U.S. Border Patrol Chief Michael Banks. Multi-agency enforcement actions led to the removal of 1,650 Mexican nationals in the past month. Las autoridades de México rescataron a un ciudadano estadounidense que había secuestrado mientras conducía por una carretera mexicana por presuntos miembros de un cartel. El secuestro se produce en un momento en que México ha estado bajo una presión extrema para detener a los cárteles de la droga que siguen operando en muchas partes del país. Authorities in Mexico rescued a U.S. citizen who cartel gunmen kidnapped as he was driving along a Mexican highway at night. The kidnapping comes at a time when Mexico has been under extreme pressure to stop drug cartels, which operate with impunity in many parts of the country. A report from the Panamanian government’s national border service, Senafront, indicates migrants are now employing the same boat smugglers who once ferried them from Colombia to Panama to return them home. The Panamanian agency refers to the process as “inverse” migration. The Senate Special Committee on Aging holds a hearing on combatting America’s ongoing opioid epidemic on Wednesday, February 26. The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation holds a hearing on combatting drug trafficking on Wednesday, February 26. Since last year, Mexico has been trying to get the United States to return arrested drug lord Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada. This week, the country’s attorney general complained that the United States has been ignoring their requests. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents and other state and local law enforcement officials arrested 118 illegal aliens during Monday’s immigration raid inside the Colony Ridge Subdivision near Houston, Texas. According to ICE, the multi-agency immigration raid netted migrants charged with a myriad of criminal charges and criminal convictions. Las autoridades de México arrestaron a un fugitivo que era el líder de una organización familiar de narcotráfico que trabajaba con varios cárteles que desde principios de la década de 2000 establecieron rutas desde Guatemala hasta la frontera con Texas. El fugitivo se escondía en un lujoso vecindario en el estado fronterizo de Nuevo León. Authorities in Mexico arrested an elusive fugitive who was the alleged leader of a family-run drug smuggling operation that worked with various cartels which, since the early 2000s, established routes from Guatemala to the Texas border. The fugitive was hiding in a ritzy neighborhood in the border state of Nuevo Leon. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers arrested a three-time deported Salvadoran illegal alien on charges of repeated sexual abuse of a child. The arrest occurred during a targeted enforcement operation in Colony Ridge — the largest migrant colony in Texas. A multi-agency manhunt for a seven-time deported Salvadoran illegal alien wanted for murder came to a head Monday night, with the subject taken safely into custody. The suspected MS-13 gang member took off on Monday after allegedly stabbing a neighbor in the Colony Ridge subdivision. Colony Ridge is reported to be Texas’ largest migrant colony.

Breitbart,Israel / Middle East,https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/,"One of President Donald Trump’s golf courses in Scotland was vandalised by a group of “pro-Palestinian” protesters, defacing the property with graffiti and digging up the greens.  The Trump administration has reportedly revoked the visa of a student who protested in favor of Hamas, the Islamic terrorist organization which attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, according to Fox News. King Salman bin Abdulaziz expressed strong support for the President’s efforts to create a “new world order” based on coexistence and cooperation. President of Argentina Javier Milei reportedly plans to have the South American nation sign a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Israel. The government of Syria under the control of jihadist terror organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) imposed curfews on multiple western regions of the country on Thursday and Friday following what is believed to have been an armed uprising by fighters loyal to deposed dictator Bashar Assad, who fled to Russia in December. The Chinese Foreign Ministry declared its support on Wednesday for Egypt’s attempt to galvanize the Arab world into supporting a plan for the reconstruction of Gaza, intended to prevent President Donald Trump from taking the territory over. President Donald Trump met with eight freed Israeli and American-Israeli hostages in the Oval Office on Wednesday, saying he was deeply moved by the experience and vowing to punish Hamas and Gaza generally if all are not released. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened further destruction of Gaza if all remaining hostages are not released, and issued an ultimatum to Hamas leaders to flee. Palestinians are looking at the Arab plan for rebuilding Gaza with “cautious optimism,” but they apparently lack faith in Arab leaders to follow through. An affidavit released Wednesday revealed that an alleged architect of the 2021 Abbey Gate suicide bombing that killed 13 American service members in Afghanistan was released from prison just two weeks before the attack — which coincides with when thousands of prisoners were released from the Bagram Air Base after the Biden administration abandoned it. President Donald Trump has decided to bypass Egypt and Qatar as middlemen, and negotiate directly with Hamas for the release of the remaining hostages, breaking a taboo against negotiating with terrorists in order to achieve a result. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet found a dramatic rise in obesity and overweight status, particularly among young people, in the Middle East, The National reported on Monday, highlighting the contrasts in a region also suffering significant malnutrition. The Senate Judiciary Committee holds a hearing on addressing the rise of antisemitism in America on Wednesday, March 5. The Trump administration has rejected a $53 billion reconstruction proposal for Gaza by Arab states, calling it unrealistic due to Gaza’s “uninhabitable” conditions, Hamas’s control, and the lack of clarity on who would fund the billions needed for rebuilding. During CNN’s coverage of President Donald Trump’s speech before Congress, CNN host and Chief National Security Analyst Jim Scuitto stated that the arrest of one of the terrorists involved in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing is a “significant arrest” of a President Donald Trump mentioned the hostages in Gaza, however briefly, in his address to a special joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. Egypt is hosting a summit on Tuesday of Arab nations intended to finalize the provisions for a comprehensive plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip. Egypt has proposed its alternative to President Donald Trump’s idea of annexing Gaza and moving its inhabitants: spend $53 billion to remove the rubble and rebuild Gaza, in the same place, with the same people, next to Israel. Iran adorned Tehran with banners featuring images from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s disastrous White House visit. Syria’s “interim president” Ahmed al-Sharaa on Sunday created a seven-member committee to draft a new national constitution. The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a Kurdish separatist terror group that has been fighting a violent insurgency against the Turkish government since 1984, announced a unilateral ceasefire on Saturday. Iranian Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif resigned on Sunday evening, strongly implying in his resignation letter that he was forced out by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameni and other theocratic hardliners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a video Sunday thanking President Donald Trump profusely for his help in what seemed a pointed and deliberate contrast to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s behavior. The filmmakers for “No Other Land” accused the US of blocking peace in Israel after winning the Oscar for Best Documentary on Sunday night.  The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Friday that it would be sending the Federal Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, headed by civil rights lawyer Leo Terrell, to ten university campuses to conduct investigations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Sunday that Israel will be halting all movement of goods into Gaza, following Hamas’s apparent rejection of a ceasefire proposal suggested by President Donald Trump’s envoy. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed an order on Saturday that will expedite the shipment of $4 billion in military aid to Israel — a direct and deliberate contrast to President Joe Biden’s policy of withholding some arms. Israel accepted a new proposal by the Trump administration on Saturday night, under which all of the 63 remaining hostages would be released over the course of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, en route to a permanent ceasefire. Freed Israeli hostage Eli Sharabi has described the conditions in which he was held by Hamas in Gaza, including torture and starvation that caused him to lose 40% of his body weight until he was released earlier this month. Over 150 members of Congress expressed support for a resolution endorsing the Iranian resistance movement against the “murderous” and “terrorist” Islamic Republic, while advocating for a secular, democratic Iran. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released the results of its inquiry into its own failures in responding to the October 7, 2023, terror attack by Hamas on Thursday, finding it had underestimated Hamas and misunderstood it as pragmatic. Officials said 13 people were injured during a car-ramming attack at a bus stop in Israel, the Jewish News Syndicate reported on Thursday. The first phase of a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Hamas was completed early Thursday when the Palestinian terrorist group handed over four corpses belonging to hostages whom it murdered on October 7 and afterwards. Syria’s “interim president,” Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda leader and head of the jihadi insurgent group that deposed dictator Bashar Assad in December, visited Jordan on Wednesday for security talks with King Abdullah II. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Wednesday that Iran has accelerated its enrichment of uranium since the election of President Donald Trump in November, apparently racing toward a nuclear weapon before he can stop it.

But they’re right that something has changed in American cities. And what it means for US climate goals. It’s about more than just the blue light. If high inflation hurts just about everyone, why can’t we have no inflation? We set out to solve why a forest in the middle of Uruguay looked like that — and wound up discovering something much bigger. AI is supposed to help militaries make precise strikes.

The human mind is designed to predict, but uncertainty helps us thrive. Scientists are getting better at predicting the sun’s antics. Billions of dollars later, neuroscientists are still struggling to address the mental health crisis. (And wait until you hear about Pesto the penguin.) Bacteria-eating viruses might be able to fight antibiotic resistance where new treatments are most needed. This storm showed us how mega-storms are worsening. And how unprepared we are.

The future of American politics is being hashed out on podcasts. This DOGE cut could actually cost the government money. Polls show DOGE’s federal government purge is politically polarizing. Don’t bank on it. ﻿Joseph Haldeman wanted a dictatorship of engineers. DOGE would have made him proud. Ames v. Ohio should be an easy — and potentially unanimously decided — case, assuming the Court doesn’t overreach. It’s a vital moment for AI policy. DOGE’s mass firings could trash vital expertise. The best answer — AI has “jagged intelligence” — lies in between hype and skepticism. Remember: You’re smarter than the scammers. Why we should start caring about the right to brain privacy now. Elon Musk’s group is pushing to access the IRS’ most sensitive information. OpenAI’s conversion to for-profit is sketchy. Musk’s $97 billion offer shows why. ﻿What should the main Democratic message to Americans be right now? Elon Musk is using the anti-teacher playbook against the entire civil workforce. ﻿The lawsuit asks a very simple question: Who appointed Musk, and what, exactly, does he do?

At The Federalist, we understand we are in an information war with a corrupt media complex that is trying to undermine America and the founding values that made this nation great. In war, controlling the airspace is imperative. In this information war, media is our airspace — and corporate media still have full operational control. Big Tech has joined forces with corporate media to create a new censorship regime. They funnel money to these media conglomerates to implement mechanisms to control the flow of information. This results in biased “fact-checking,” the suppression of dissident voices, and content censorship at a massive scale. For more than a decade, The Federalist has fought diligently in the ongoing information war to inform the public on the most pressing news of the day — from the Russia-collusion hoax, to the Brett Kavanaugh character assassination, to the suppression of the Biden family business and the rigged 2020 election. Our reporting exposes the corruption of corporate media, Big Tech, and political figures while inserting an alternative perspective into national conversations. With the help of donors like you, The Federalist can continue to expose the masses to the TRUTH. America is desperate for bold leaders who can withstand the attacks Big Tech and corporate media are willing to throw at them. The Federalist has proven time and time again that we have the courage to stand for the truth.Sincerely, Mollie HemingwayEditor-in-ChiefThe Federalist The Federalist Online Magazine is supported by the FDRLST Real Journalism Fund, a 501c3 organization, and donations are tax-deductible. If you would like to donate by mail, contact donate@thefederalist.com for more information. © 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

The Federalist,CNN Forced To Fact-Check Itself After Claiming Trump Lied About Transgender Mice,https://thefederalist.com/2025/03/06/cnn-forced-to-fact-check-itself-after-claiming-trump-lied-about-transgender-mice/,"In his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, President Donald Trump highlighted the “appalling waste” in government spending, including $8 million being allocated to making mice “transgender.” Trump’s point was crystal clear: Taxpayers are spending millions on research trying to prove that it’s OK to pump boys full of estrogen and girls full of testosterone. Instead of acknowledging the absurdity of such waste in funding, CNN immediately denounced the statement as “false” in their bogus “fact-check” of Trump’s speech, and other members of the propaganda press followed suit. But now, CNN has been forced to walk back its own reporting that President Donald Trump’s statement was a lie.  “DOGE and transgender mice: Trump falsely claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency identified government spending of ‘$8 million for making mice transgender,'” CNN’s Deidre McPhillips originally wrote, according to a post shared on X by Libs of TikTok. CNN just quietly edited their ""fact check"" article after they reported that Trump's statement on spending $8 million for making mice transgender was ""false.""It sounds so crazy that they thought Trump made it up…It’s 100% true and now even CNN is forced to admit it pic.twitter.com/oVETMXbKQG The article has since been updated with an editor’s note admitting: “An earlier version of this item incorrectly characterized as false Trump’s claim about federal money being spent for ‘making mice transgender.'” The update claimed to add “context” to Trump’s statement, but the “context” essentially admits that Trump was right. “The morning after Trump’s speech, the White House provided a list of $8.3 million in federal grants to health studies that involve mice receiving treatments that can be used in gender-affirming health care,” the updated version reads. “The White House list made clear what Trump, in the speech, did not: The studies were meant to figure out how these treatments might affect the health of humans who take them, not for the purpose of making mice transgender.” On Wednesday, the White House released a statement entitled “Yes, Biden Spent Millions on Transgender Animal Experiments.” The statement highlights a $455,000 grant for “A Mouse Model to Test the Effects of Gender-affirming Hormone Therapy on HIV Vaccine-induced Immune Responses,” along with a $299,940 grant for “Gender-Affirming Testosterone Therapy on Breast Cancer Risk and Treatment Outcomes.”  Still, other legacy media outlet reporters like the Rolling Stone’s Miles Klee peddled the claim that the government wasn’t really funding research to make mice transgender — they were just funding research to analyze cancer risks for “female-to-male trans individuals.” NBC News’ Jo Yurcaba said “it’s unclear exactly what Trump was referring to” when he referenced the federal funding used to make mice transgender — before linking the same White House statement detailing the “millions” Biden spent on “transgender animal experiments.” If CNN — which was found by a jury earlier this year to be a literal fake news outlet — and the rest of the corporate media are so intent on “fact-checking,” maybe they should start with their own erroneous “reporting.”  © 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

The American Conservative,No Title,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/fellows/,"  The U.S. Constitution is everywhere cited, but what is the Constitution really? The Constitution of the United States, as framed by the founders of our republic, assumes an entire view of human nature, society, and politics and has moral and cultural preconditions. Without virtuous citizens who respect and embody the spirit of constitutionalism, the Constitution becomes little more than what James Madison called a “parchment barrier”. To understand the text of the Constitution — and to ensure its revitalization and perpetuation — it is necessary to understand its historical sources and the view of life that it implies. Statesmanship, in turn, requires the prudent application of these ideas to the concrete issues of policy that animate contemporary political life. The Constitutional Fellows Program is a one month and a half course (five weekly seminars) of study designed for Congressional staffers, journalists, and other policy professionals. Offered at a time when America’s constitutional order faces unprecedented challenges, the program illuminates the meaning of the Constitution, examines prospects for its reinvigoration, and explores its application to selected issues in public policy. Fellows participate in five rigorous sessions over the course of a semester, examining various aspects of the Constitution, its sources, and its relationship to current politics and policy: This program has been featured in both the RealClearPublicAffairs American Civics Portal and New Oxford Review as an exemplary civic education program. Each session will have a seminar format and will be conducted by one or two discussants drawn from conservative institutions or academia. Students will prepare for each session by studying carefully chosen and manageable readings drawn from a variety of thinkers in the American conservative and broader Western tradition. Please note, sessions are held on Friday afternoons in downtown Washington, D.C. at the offices of The American Conservative. Those admitted will be expected to attend all sessions in-person. Faculty discussants have included in house TAC scholars and leadership, and also: . . . and others. Students who attend at least four of the five sessions will be certified as graduates of the Constitutional Fellows Program and will have their name and bio added to the alum. Only a limited number of students can be admitted into this highly competitive program. To be considered, applicants must submit a packet during the application period. The application packet should contain: Packets should be emailed to smaitra@theamericanconservative.com. Students who are admitted will pay a $25.00 enrollment fee and should be prepared to supply a brief biography and a recent headshot. When paying the fee, please enter $25 in the ‘other amount’ box under “Your Donation” from the donate page. The American Conservative relies on the generosity of our members and readers to sustain the Constitutional Fellows Program. If you would like to stand with us and support our work educating the rising generation of leaders in conservative principles, please contact Nicholas Bartulovic at nbartulovic@theamericanconservative.com or Sumantra Maitra at smaitra@theamericanconservative.com or visit www.theamericanconservative.com/donate to make your tax-deductible gift.

As a Reader, you can use your Substack account to subscribe to or follow other Creators’ Substack content. Posting Content on Substack First and foremost, you own what you create.

There are a few rules that apply to all Posts: Don’t Infringe: Your Posts should not violate someone else’s (including Substack’s) rights.

Substack has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.  Miscellaneous Terms The above covers most of the questions that we typically receive about Substack. We have grouped provisions that come up less frequently below: Indemnification: To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Substack, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of Substack (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action, we will attempt to provide notice to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder). Assignment: You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Substack account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without our prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent. Choice of Law: These Terms are governed by and will be construed under applicable federal law and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver: Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration in San Francisco County, California, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and Substack shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of these Terms, you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding arising out of these Terms will be entitled to an award of costs and attorneys’ fees.

We agree that arbitrators may not conduct any class, consolidated, or representative proceeding, and are limited to providing relief warranted by an individual party's claim. No Third-Party Beneficiaries: We agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms. No Joint Venture: You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Substack Inc., and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind us in any respect whatsoever.  Waiver: The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.  Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.  Entire Agreement: You agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and us, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.",document term use privacy policy publisher agreement content guideline copyright

Please note that Creators control their own publications; accordingly, when you interact with a Creator’s publication in a way that requires your personal information, including when commenting on a publication that you have not subscribed to, that personal information is provided directly to the Creator. Our Service Providers: We share your Personal Information with third-party service providers that provide services on our behalf; for example, we use Stripe (a third party payment provider) to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Such third parties further include, but are not limited to, providers of: website hosting; maintenance services; email services; security services; content delivery networks; customer support operations and software services; traffic and usage analytics services; and cloud storage and computing services. Third-Party Data Controllers: We provide integrations with third-party services for you to use at your option. When we do, we only use the Personal Information we collect from the integrated third-party service for the purpose of providing the integration to you, and do not disclose that information except where required by law or as directed by the third-party service. Please keep in mind that you may use an integrated third-party service to send your Personal Information or content to the provider of the integrated third-party service, in which case you should refer to the privacy policy of the applicable third-party service provider to understand how your Personal Information is used. For instance, you may use Substack to upload content to YouTube, in which case the Google privacy policy governs how YouTube uses your Personal Information. Other users: If your user profile allows it, you may choose to populate certain user profile information, including, without limitation, your name, subscriptions, publications, location, and any image content. Any user profile information uploaded may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the services (including when you post comments or upload images or videos through the services). Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Your username and user profile may also be displayed to other users when you interact with a publication post, for instance, by “liking” the post or leaving a comment. You may have the option to allow Substack to share information on what you’ve read or are reading on Substack with the public, or with other accounts socially connected to your own, such as your social media followers. If you opt into contact syncing through our app, your profile information will be shared with any user who has (i) also opted into contact syncing, and who (ii) identified you as a contact. Prospective sellers or buyers: We may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the sale or merger of our business or assets (subject to local laws). Also, if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control. Government authorities, law enforcement officials, and court-ordered disclosures: If required for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy, if mandated by law or if required for the legal protection of our legitimate interests in compliance with applicable laws we may share Personal Information with competent regulatory, prosecuting, tax or governmental authorities, courts or other tribunals, or with litigants entitled by law to receive personal information, in any jurisdiction or markets, domestic or foreign. In certain cases, we may anonymize your Personal Information in such a way that you can no longer be identified as an individual, and we reserve the right to use and share such anonymized information to trusted partners not specified here. However, we never disclose aggregated or de-identified information in a manner that could identify you as an individual. Where will we send your Personal Information? Substack is established in the US and uses service providers established both in the US and in other countries to process Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. As such, your Personal Information may be shared internationally.Does Substack participate in the Data Privacy Framework? To facilitate the lawful import of Personal Information from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the Swiss Confederation, Substack participates in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) (each, a “DPF”). To verify our participation, please consult the Data Privacy Framework List. When we receive Personal Information under a DPF, the DPF Principles apply to our processing of that information. Under any DPF, we are accountable for the onward transfer of Personal Information, and only transfer Personal Information received pursuant to a DPF under agreements that provide the same protections as the DPF. Our adherence to the DPFs specified above is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In the event of a dispute between you and us regarding our use of Personal Information under a DPF, we ask that you first raise the dispute with us directly at privacy@substackinc.com. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your DPF Principles-related complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your DPF Principles-related complaint to your satisfaction, please visit https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request for more information or to file a complaint. These dispute resolution services are provided at no cost to you. If you have a “residual claim” regarding our use of your Personal Information under a DPF that is unresolved after (i) direct contact with us; (ii) your use of the independent dispute resolution mechanism identified above; and (iii) your raising the issue with your data protection authority, you have the the right to seek redress through binding arbitration in accordance with the applicable DPF. Is Personal Information about you secure? Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, failure of the services, or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. Privacy and your direct messages You can use Substack to send direct messages to other Substack users, and to receive direct messages from other Substack users. Please note that, at this time, direct messages are not end-to-end encrypted, and are not a substitute for secure messaging services. Direct messaging contents are disclosed to their intended recipients. Recipients of direct messages may keep those messages even if you request their deletion, and even if you delete your Substack account. Keep in mind that recipients of your direct messages do not necessarily have any obligation to keep them private. We will only disclose direct message contents to people other than the intended recipients in very limited circumstances where allowed or required by law, for example, in response to valid court orders or in emergency situations involving danger of death or serious physical injury. While we maintain strict internal access controls on direct messaging content, keep in mind that Substack personnel may access the contents of direct messages to enforce our Terms of Use, ensure the security of our platform, to provide user support, or as otherwise necessary to provide our services. We may also use automated means to ensure the safety of direct messaging content, including scanning for spam, malicious content, and child abuse material. Privacy and SMS Services If you provide us with your phone number, we may use a third-party service provider to verify your phone number with an SMS text message. Information regarding this SMS verification is used only for verification purposes, and is not shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes. What are your rights? Depending on applicable local laws, you may be entitled to ask Substack for a copy of your Personal Information, to correct it, erase or restrict its processing, or to ask us to transfer some of this information to other organizations. You may also have rights to object to some processing activities or to request restriction of some processing activities. Where we have asked for your consent to process your Personal Information, you may also have the right to withdraw this consent. These rights may be limited in some situations or in accordance with applicable law – for example, we cannot delete your Personal Information when we can demonstrate that we have a legal obligation to retain it. In some instances, this may mean that we are able to retain data even if you withdraw your consent or you delete your account. Where we require Personal Information to comply with legal or contractual obligations, then provision of such information is mandatory: if such information is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual relationship, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other cases, provision of requested personal data is optional. Please note we will always inform you where the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or optional. We hope that we can satisfy any queries you may have about the way we process your Personal Information. If you have any concerns about how we process your Personal Information, or would like to opt out of marketing, you can get in touch at privacy@substackinc.com. If you are a California consumer, please see the section further below titled “Additional Notices for California Residents” for more notices regarding your Personal Information. You can access, edit, or delete some personal information by yourself Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us: name and password email address user profile information, including images you may have uploaded to the site The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the services change. If you'd like to delete your account, you can do so from your account page. Where you have directed third-party services to provide Personal Information to us, you can direct those third-party service providers to stop providing us your Personal Information. For example, you can use your Google security settings page to revoke our access to information from your YouTube account. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at privacy@substackinc.com. You can unsubscribe from our marketing communications You may unsubscribe from our marketing communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our e-mails, updating your communication preferences or by contacting us at privacy@substackinc.com. We remind you that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any processing of your Personal Information by Substack as a data processor on behalf of a Creator. A Creator’s own terms and policies govern its use of Personal Information it collects on the Creator’s subdomain on the services, including their own marketing emails and other communications. You have the right to complain to your local data protection authority In the event you have unresolved concerns, please note that you have the right to complain to a data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the EEA, Switzerland and certain non-European countries are available here. How long will Substack retain your data? We retain information about you only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. We may retain your Personal Information for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you. Automated individual decision-making, including profiling We may use the information we collect to profile you in order to suggest content on our platform that is relevant to your interests. We also use automated systems to help flag content that may violate our Content Guidelines or our Terms of Use. At this time, no final content moderation decisions are made without human review of any automated decisions.   Cookies We use cookies on our website.

 In the malignity of his intent and the scale of his graft, the second term is significantly worse. But it’s also his last. 
D.D. Guttenplan  No president in the post-civil-rights era has been as racially aggressive as the now-47th president. 
Clarence Lusane for The Nation  With Trump back in the White House, the Democrats are floundering instead of fighting. 
Chris Lehmann  The president is taking a chain saw to our public health infrastructure—and people will die as a result. 
Gregg Gonsalves  The DNC elects a new leader as it seeks to unify the party and win back working-class voters. 
John Nichols  The LA disaster is a wake-up call: Our firefighting playbook was written for a world that no longer exists. We need a new approach, and we need it now. 
Lazo Gitchos  The Nation’s Western correspondent, Sasha Abramsky, captures the destruction of the Palisades fire and the relics of the people who used to live in one debris zone. 
Sasha Abramsky  The elder Le Pen is dead, but far-right populists across the world still echo his mix of violent rhetoric, brazen lies, and outreach to mainstream conservatives. 
David A. Bell  Sure, it’s a dog whistle for “retvrn” types and the results are tacky—but that’s not the worst part. 
Kate Wagner  Today’s tech oligarchs want the appearance of public acclaim for their deeply elitist vision of society—while maintaining a docile and cooperative public. 
John Ganz  Immigrants don’t steal citizens’ jobs and wages. They grow the economy for all. 
Bryce Covert  
Calvin Trillin  The corporate media’s commitment to fighting autocracy proves fickle. 
Jeet Heer  Donald Trump is poised to become the first president since FDR to have appointed the majority of high-court justices. His potential picks are terrifying. 
Elie Mystal  Since Israel invaded Gaza in 2023, far-right settlers have set their sights on the Strip—and they have no intention of letting a ceasefire stand in their way.  
Joshua Leifer  The Pakistani qawwali icon sang words written centuries ago and died decades ago. He’s got a new album out. 
Hasan Ali  More than 20 years after Bill Clinton left office, Democrats remain in the grips of his New Democrat politics. That’s a serious problem. 
Lily Geismer  Incumbent parties around the world keep losing to upstart challengers. Yet Mexico’s López Obrador defied the trend, handing off his presidency to Sheinbaum. What’s their secret? 
Waleed Shahid  In the first English translation in half a century, Paul Reitter and Paul North distill the essence of the Marxist masterpiece by going back to basics. 
Alyssa Battistoni  Walker’s new installation at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art offers us visions from both the past and future. 
Rachel Hunter Himes  Why did one of the early 20th century’s most famous philosophers go out of fashion? 
John Banville  In “Hard Truths,” Leigh reminds us that a family dinner can tell the story of a whole society. 
J. Hoberman   In the frenzied medical drama, the limits and problems of the healthcare system serve as the basis for the show’s plot.

The New Republic,Trump Flips Out When Asked About Testy Musk and Rubio Clash,https://newrepublic.com/feeds/168326/breaking-news,"While speaking to the press in the Oval Office Friday, Donald Trump got upset when a reporter asked him about “clashes” between Elon Musk and members of his Cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during a Thursday meeting.   “No clash, I was there. You’re just a troublemaker, and you’re not supposed to be asking that question because we’re talking about the World Cup,” Trump replied, referring to an executive he had just signed to prepare for the 2026 games. “Elon gets along great with Marco, and they’re both doing a fantastic job. There is no clash.”  When the reporter tried to follow up, Trump asked him, “Who are you with?” The reporter replied, “NBC,” to which Trump said, “No wonder. That’s enough. NBC.”   ""You're not supposed to be asking that question ... that's enough"" -- Trump gets mad at and shuts down a reporter who tries to ask him about reported clashes between Musk and Rubio pic.twitter.com/yZtzwAZ426 In the Cabinet meeting, Musk had reportedly complained that Rubio hadn’t fired anyone from the State Department, despite recommendations from Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, according to The New York Times. Rubio fired back at Musk, noting that 1,500 officials had taken the government’s deferred resignation “buyout” program. Trump finally stepped in to defend Rubio, saying he was doing a “great job.” Musk also reportedly argued with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over the purge of federal workers, with Duffy complaining that Musk tried to fire air traffic controllers. Musk accused Duffy of lying, and the two argued, with Musk claiming that air traffic control towers were staffed with so-called DEI hires. The Times reported that Trump ended the argument by saying that Duffy should hire air traffic controllers who were “geniuses” from MIT. Trump has long had a contentious relationship with the press, and in his second term, has sought to take action against media outlets he doesn’t like, taking over control of the press pool that covers the White House from the White House Correspondents’ Association and shutting out the Associated Press for not adopting his name change of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Who knows if he’ll now punish NBC for simply asking questions.  Republicans have censured Representative Al Green and petitioned to strip him of his committee assignments for interrupting Donald Trump’s speech to Congress. But by Friday, Representative Lauren Boebert had decided to sling some mud on the situation for good measure. “For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent,” Boebert, who was caught on surveillance footage fondling her date during a showing of Beetlejuice in 2023, told Real America’s Voice. Boebert was referring to the 77-year-old Texas Democrat’s walking cane. When Trump claimed during his Tuesday night speech that he had been given a “mandate” by the American people to radically reimagine the federal government, Green interrupted the president by yelling, “You have no mandate to cut Medicaid!” That got Green ousted by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called on the sergeant of arms to remove the 77-year-old from the chamber against a backdrop of jeers from Republicans. “I did it from my heart, and I will suffer whatever the consequences are,” Green told reporters the next day. “But truthfully, I would do it again.” Senate Republicans are working to pass a budget that even party members have recently admitted will result in a $880 billion cut to Medicaid, much to the chagrin of their own constituents. The multibillion-dollar cut is a trade-off for conservatives who were tasked by Donald Trump to extend his 2017 tax plan, which will overwhelmingly benefit corporations and is projected to add as much as $15 trillion to the national deficit. Green’s protest was practically the only noticeable rejection of Trump’s agenda that Democrats could muster Tuesday night. Other liberal lawmakers were torched for flipping paddles that read “False,” “Musk Steals,” and “Save Medicaid” in a silent protest in the face of the administration’s apparent oligarchy and its systemic dismantling of the federal government. And viewers watching live at home would never have known that a handful of Democrats stood up and walked out of the chamber in protest, as TV cameras never bothered to pan to their mute, “dignified” spectacle. Others, such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Patty Murray, opted to not show up at all. Donald Trump is continuing to crack down on free speech by threatening to revoke a program that forgives the student loans of federal and non-profit employees, teachers, police, and pastors, among others.  Trump signed an executive order Friday barring individuals who engaged in “improper” activities from receiving relief under the government’s Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, a Bush-era policy that cancels student loans after 10 years of payments.  This move is clearly intended to have a chilling effect on the work of non-profits, which operate in some of the policy spaces most affected by Trump’s agenda, such as immigration. Under Trump’s order, loan forgiveness could be stripped away from individuals who provide legal support, advocacy, or education work on behalf of undocumented immigrants.  In addition to targeting work on illegal immigration, the White House said that the order would exclude individuals whose work had been tied to foreign terrorist groups. This is a clear sign they intend to continue cracking down on pro-Palestinian advocacy and activism.  The Trump administration previously threatened to revoke federal funding from any schools that allow large protests, and on Thursday announced it would cancel $400 million in grants to Columbia University for “inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” Meanwhile, earlier this week, the university once again sicced police officers on its own peaceful student protesters, and has begun investigating students over speech critical of Israel.  As of December, more than two million Americans had eligible employment and open student loans, according to the Associated Press. While only a small percentage of claims are eligible for relief through PSLF, the work of hundreds of groups may be affected by Trump’s order.  Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, wrote on X Friday that Trump’s order was “shockingly unlawful and a clear First Amendment violation.” “The PSLF program provides the president no authority to restrict it to only those people who work for nonprofits whose work he supports,” Reichlin-Melnick wrote. “Expect lawsuits within short periods of time.” DropSite News’s Ryan Grim sarcastically quipped that he’d heard from the Supreme Court that “the president can’t change the terms of student loans,” a dig at the high court blocking President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness efforts. The Trump administration is canceling $400 million in grants to Columbia University over what it says is “the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” In reality, the president is clamping down on pro-Palestine protests that began in late 2023, when Israel responded to Hamas’s attack on the country with a brutal military campaign that human rights organizations have called genocide. Columbia had some of the highest profile protests of any American college campus at the time, setting up an encampment and briefly occupying a university building.  On Thursday, the administration’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, made up of staffers from the Justice Department, Health and Human Services Department, Education Department, and the General Services Administration, told Columbia that it would soon be conducting a “comprehensive review” of their federal grants and contracts. That review seems to have taken all of one day.  In a statement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon implied that Columbia did not comply with federal laws against discrimination.  “Since October 7, Jewish students have faced relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-Semitic harassment on their campuses — only to be ignored by those who are supposed to protect them,” the statement read. “Universities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding. For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.” Left out of the statement was the fact that the university is facing a lawsuit from three students alleging civil rights violations, breach of contract, negligence, unlawful eviction, and other Title VI violations over Columbia’s harsh crackdown on pro-Palestine student protesters.  In recent months, the university’s new disciplinary committee, the Office of Institutional Equity, has brought several cases of discriminatory harassment against students who expressed criticism of Israel. “Infractions” include writing an op-ed in the student newspaper calling for divestment from Israel, sharing social media posts supporting the Palestinian people, or joining “unauthorized protests.”  These actions appear to have been for naught in the eyes of the Trump administration, which appears to be trying to make an example out of Columbia and suppress criticism of Israel and support for Palestine. Trump is fulfilling a threat he made on Tuesday, when he said in a Truth Social post that “All Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests” and threatened to deport foreign students who take part in such protests.  The notion of “illegal protests,” particularly in places like colleges and universities which have a long legacy of protesting going back decades, seems to be a massive violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment, and contradicts Trump’s own claim that he “stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America.” But Trump has never been consistent on any principles, and seeks to punish anyone who goes against his views.  Donald Trump is desperately trying to solve the country’s egg crisis, and failing. Amid a record-breaking outbreak of avian flu that’s decimated egg production across the country, the cost of eggs has skyrocketed. Nationwide, a dozen eggs sold for $4.95 on average in January, up from $2.52 last year. Trump’s solution? To import 70 million–100 million perishable and fragile eggs from other countries within the next month. The plan is as foolproof as it sounds. With a short shelf life, strict trade requirements for animal products, and countries abroad experiencing their own egg shortages due to bird flu, Trump is realizing that importing eggs isn’t easy. Despite the rise in demand from the United States, there aren’t enough eggs to ship; just 3 percent of the world’s egg supply enters global trade. “It’s a very local industry. If you want to rebalance the market, you need big volumes. It’s almost impossible, in the short term, to do that,” animal protein expert Nan-Dirk Mulder told Bloomberg. Some of the world’s top egg-exporting countries have received egg-import requests from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bloomberg reported. But Poland faces health certification barriers for selling eggs in U.S. retail stores. Last month, the U.S. pulled import licenses for eggs from the Netherlands—the world’s top egg exporter—due to industry practice concerns, but Trump plans to reinstate the license in a desperate bid to get Americans their eggs. As usual, the president and his cronies are blaming Democrats, not the disease that’s killed more than 166 million commercial birds and devastated farms across the country. “This shows the price of eggs over the last 40 years,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in an interview with Fox News, while pointing to a graph. “As you can see, the price was pretty static for 40 years, 50 years actually, and then all of a sudden under Obama it went up a little bit, Trump went down, and then Biden it has skyrocketed.” Amid the excuses, consumers, retailers, and farmers continue to pay the price. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, alongside other miffed agency heads,  laid into billionaire bureaucrat Elon Musk during Thursday’s meeting of Donald Trump’s Cabinet, according to The New York Times.  During the meeting, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency complained that Rubio had fired “nobody,” despite the sweeping government layoffs recommended by his organization.   The secretary of state, who was already seething after Musk had axed USAID, an agency within Rubio’s purview, unleashed onto Musk in front of the president’s entire Cabinet.  Rubio claimed that Musk was lying, conveniently forgetting the 1,500 officials who had taken the government’s offer for deferred resignation. Rubio even asked whether Musk wanted him to hire all of them back, just so he could fire them in a more outrageous fashion, according to the Times. Rubio then tried to lay out his plans to reorganize his agency, which didn’t impress the DOGE czar, either.  Musk remarked that it was a good thing Rubio was so “good on TV.”  In the end, Trump defended Rubio, who he said was doing a “great job” and was incredibly busy implementing Trump’s agenda.  About 700 State Department employees, including 450 career diplomats, have resigned in the last two months. The Times reported Friday that senior officials at the State Department have drawn up plans to close a dozen consulates overseas by the summer, and are considering wider shutdowns—a move that will likely undermine U.S. soft power around the world.  Rubio wasn’t the only one who got into it with the DOGE czar. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy also got heated over Musk’s efforts to shrink the federal workforce, and accused him of trying to fire air traffic controllers. His accusation comes amid a national shortage of the highly essential workers, and following several high-profile plane crashes.  Musk said that Duffy’s claim was a “lie,” and the two went back and forth. When Musk demanded names, Duffy said there were none because he had stepped in before the positions could actually be terminated.  Musk then baselessly claimed that the Federal Aviation Authority had staffed air traffic control towers with so-called DEI hires, which Duffy denied. Trump ended that argument by demanding Duffy hire air traffic controllers who were “geniuses” from MIT, the Times reported.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to launch a study on connections between vaccines and autism, despite extensive research debunking the conspiracy theory. The move comes weeks after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long history of opposing vaccination, was confirmed as secretary of health and human services. It’s not clear if he is involved with the decision. Right now, the United States is in the midst of a massive measles outbreak resulting in two deaths and more than 150 infections, and Kennedy’s response has been lackluster. Kennedy downplayed the first recorded measles death in a decade last week, and since then, has refused to endorse the vaccine and instead touted therapeutic remedies like vitamin A, alarming experts. Last month, on Kennedy’s first day heading the department, the CDC laid off half of its Epidemic Intelligence Service, otherwise known as the “Disease Detectives,” axing 1,260 employees. This latest move gives in to the conspiracy theory of a link between vaccines and autism, which is fueled by a rise in diagnoses that researchers say is really due to more screenings taking place. In the late 1990s, a now-discredited and debunked British study connected autism to the widespread administration of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. During his address to Congress on Tuesday, President Trump mentioned the rise in autism among children, tasking Kennedy with finding the cause. “So, we’re going to find out what it is, and there’s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you,” Trump said. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy denied being anti-vaccine, although he refused to acknowledge that there were no proven links between vaccines and autism. And Trump NIH nominee Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said during his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this week that he “would support a broad scientific agenda based on data to get an answer to” the rise in autism rates. It seems that, in terms of public health, the Trump administration has now adopted the philosophy of “We’re just asking questions.” Donald Trump threatened sanctions against Russia Friday—before getting right back to blaming Ukraine for the continued fighting there.  Trump claimed in a post on Truth Social that he was “strongly considering” placing additional sanctions on Russia, referring to reports that the fighting was still ongoing in Ukraine—which he recently cut off from U.S. military aid and intelligence after clashing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week.  “Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED,” Trump wrote. “To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!”  Trump’s feeble first attempt at intimidating Russian President Vladimir Putin into ending the war comes just days after the White House reportedly started making a list of sanctions on Russia that they could lift as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing negotiations to end the invasion of Ukraine. This included lifting sanctions on individuals such as Russian oligarchs, who Trump has insisted are “very nice people.” Despite his supposedly tougher message to Russia on social media, Trump continued his capitulation to Putin during a press conference, downplaying Russia’s continued aggression toward Ukraine while finding a way to blame Ukraine for the fighting.  When asked whether he thought Putin was “taking advantage” of the pause in U.S. military aid and intelligence to continue the fighting in Ukraine, Trump practically said he agreed with the Russian onslaught.  “I actually think he’s doing what anybody else would do, I think he’s, I think he wants to get it stopped and settled and I think he’s hitting ’em harder than he’s been hitting ’em. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Friday.  “He wants to get it ended, and I think Ukraine wants to get it ended,” Trump said incredulously. “But I don’t see—it’s crazy. They’re taking tremendous punishment. I don’t quite get it.” Q: “Do you think that Vladimir Putin is taking advantage of the US pause right now on intelligence and military aid to Ukraine?”Trump: “I actually think he's doing what anybody else would do…He's been hitting them. And I think probably anybody in that position would be doing… pic.twitter.com/lZGCQl9n2A Trump’s remarks seemingly take the onus for the continued violence off Russia—and the U.S., which created the opportunity in the first place by undermining Ukraine—and place it back on Zelenskiy, whom Trump wants to paint as uncommitted to ending the fight.  In recent weeks, Trump has piled the pressure onto Zelenskiy while projecting nothing but confidence onto Putin, who is ultimately the aggressor behind Russia’s two-year, full-scale invasion.  During the Friday press conference, Trump also said that he still believes Putin “wants peace,” despite continuing to drop bombs in Ukraine. “I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine,” Trump said.  Putin vowed Thursday that Russia would not retreat from the territory it has claimed in Ukraine, and would seek a peace deal that ensured Russia’s security in the future.  In his administration’s latest attack on labor rights, Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security announced Friday it will end the collective bargaining agreement with workers at the Transportation Security Administration. “This action will ensure Americans will have a more effective and modernized workforces across the nation’s transportation networks,” the DHS said in a statement. “TSA is renewing its commitment to providing a quick and secure travel process for Americans.” Around 50,000 people are employed by the TSA and are responsible for keeping air passengers safe across the country. They screen thousands of passengers to prevent weapons and explosives from being brought into airports and aircrafts. Now, without collective bargaining, the administration will likely lose a good chunk of its workforce, putting American travelers at further risk. The DHS blamed collective bargaining for hindering “merit-based performance recognition” for TSA employees, and said it fails “to safeguard our transportation systems and keep Americans safe,” a ridiculous assertion given the job of TSA workers is to do just that—keep Americans safe. Last year, the TSA intercepted over 6,000 firearms from airport security checkpoints. Ending the agreement is yet another move from Trump that will make flying in the U.S. more chaotic and unsafe. He’s already fired hundreds of crucial employees at the Federal Aviation Administration and pushed out the former administrator of the TSA, David Peskoke. The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents over 750,000 federal government employees, slammed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s decision and defended the thousands of employees who “make sure our skies are safe for air travel” and ensure “another terrorist attack like Sept. 11 never happens again.” “They gave as a justification a completely fabricated claim about union officials—making clear this action has nothing to do with efficiency, safety, or homeland security,” the AFGE statement reads. “This is merely a pretext for attacking the rights of regular working Americans across the country because they happen to belong to a union.” A Trump supporter in Virginia says he is reconsidering his support for the president after he was racially profiled and targeted by agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE agents reportedly had their guns drawn as they interrogated and detained Jensy Machado, a Manassas resident, along with two other men he was driving home with after work. Machado told NBC News 4 Thursday night that he was not asked to produce documentation proving that he’s a U.S. citizen. “They just got out the car with the guns in their hands and said, ‘Turn off the car, give me the keys, open the window,’” Machado told the channel’s sister station, Telemundo 44. “Everything was really fast.” He said the agents were looking to deport a man who had been reported to reside at Machado’s home residence, but he did not recognize the individual’s name. “They didn’t ask me for any ID. I was telling the officer if I could give him ID, but he said to keep my hands up, not moving,” Machado, who shared his Real ID-compliant Virginia state driver’s license with the news station, continued. “And then after that he told me to get out of the car, and then he put the handcuffs on me, and then he went to me and asked how I got into this country. “I told him I was an American citizen, and he looked at his other partner [as if he was saying], ‘Do you believe this guy?’” Machado said. Machado added that the two men he was with were taken into custody, though he did not know the reason why. The whole ordeal has made Machado, a naturalized U.S. citizen, question his faith in the president and his immigration policies. He originally believed that the Trump administration would only target undocumented criminals—but now he’s not so sure. “Because, like I said, I was a Trump supporter,” Machado told NBC. “I voted for Trump last election, but, because I thought it was going to be the things, you know, like … just go against criminals, not every Hispanic-looking, like, that they will assume that we are all illegals.” ICE detained a U.S. citizen in Northern Virginia with guns drawn. He offered to show ID and told the officers he was an American citizen, but they handcuffed him anyway. The man is a Trump voter, but says he is reconsidering his support after he was targeted for being Hispanic: pic.twitter.com/NYv6JmTNst",speaking press oval office friday donald trump got upset

Mother Jones,DOGE’s Cuts to HUD Will Only Make the Housing Crisis Worse,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/doges-cuts-to-hud-will-only-make-the-housing-crisis-worse/,"Claire Bergstresser was a federal worker in HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity until last month, when she was fired as part of the DOGE purge of probationary employees.Mother Jones illustration; Photo courtesy of the Office of Rep. Ayanna Pressley  Until last month, Claire Bergstresser worked to enforce fair housing laws in the Boston branch of the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. As an equal opportunity specialist, Bergstresser investigated allegations of discrimination—something she had experienced herself as a wheelchair user who struggled to get reasonable accommodation in a previous apartment outside of Boston. In her role at HUD, Bergstresser reviewed reports from people who said they were being discriminated against in housing appraisal and rental processes because of their race, gender, sexuality, disability, or family status, among other factors. Bergstresser was passionate about the work. “I really believe in the mission [of HUD],” she said. But on Valentine’s Day, Bergstresser’s 19-month tenure as a federal employee came to an end when her supervisor told her and two colleagues they had been fired as part of Elon Musk’s purge of probationary workers across the federal government. While most federal workers’ probationary periods are one year, Bergstresser was on a two-year, renewable fellowship. These dismissals are a harbinger of what’s to come at HUD, which is now being led by newly-confirmed secretary Scott Turner, a former NFL player, Texas state legislator, housing development executive, and pastor who worked in the White House during President Donald Trump’s first term. Back then, he was in charge of overseeing so-called “opportunity zones,” a program rolled out in 2017 to give tax breaks for investors who put money into poorer neighborhoods. The results of this effort were described as “middling” by the New York Times.  Reports from NPR and the Associated Press suggest that Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will lay off half of the approximately 9,600 employees of the housing agency in the coming months. Workers in three HUD offices are anticipated to bear the brunt of the layoffs: Fair Housing, where Bergstresser worked (which is unsurprising, given the war Trump has launched on DEI across the federal government); the Office of Community Planning and Development, which distributes funds to local communities to tackle homelessness, affordable housing, and disaster relief; and the Office of Policy Development and Research, which provides data on issues such as affordable housing and disaster aid that other HUD programs rely on to function. Meanwhile, Turner has touted what he claims is a “DOGE task force” at HUD, which he says has already produced $260 million “in savings,” including by cutting $4 million in DEI-related contracts. Last month, more than two dozen Senate Democrats sent Turner a letter asking him to explain what, exactly, was eliminated as part of the alleged $260 million cuts. He does not appear to have publicly responded to their request. Working with @DOGE, we have identified $260 million in savings at @HUDgov. The American taxpayer is no longer writing a blank check for federal contracts and programs. Americans voted for reform and we’re delivering it for @POTUS. pic.twitter.com/jXtG33599h The attack on HUD comes during a national housing affordability crisis and record homelessness. There’s a shortage of more than 7 million affordable rental homes across the country for extremely low-income people, according to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC). In 2023, the Pew Research Center reports, nearly a third of American households were facing what is referred to as being cost-burdened—a metric established by HUD that refers to households spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs. HUD data also showed there was record homelessness in the US in 2024, as I wrote in December, with projections of it worsening even before the news of the planned HUD cuts. The decision last June by the Supreme Court to essentially greenlight the criminalization of unhoused people in its City of Grants Pass v. Johnson decision is likely to present even greater challenges.  If the HUD cuts take effect, “people would not be on the ground doing the work of talking to people and connecting with organizations,” said Kim Johnson, public policy manager at the NLIHC. “It would make everything that people are experiencing now—in relation to the cost of housing and rising homelessness—worse.” The HUD offices expected to be most targeted by DOGE firings directly tackle these issues. The Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD), for example, provides “core operations and funding for these really critical resources that cities, counties, states, and nonprofits use to address homelessness and housing instability in their communities,” such as homeless shelters and affordable housing, according to Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness and a former CPD official. The AP reports that more than 80 percent of that office’s staff are at risk of being cut, according to two leaked documents the news outlet obtained. Those proposed firings could “have a catastrophic effect on homelessness nationwide,” Deborah Thrope, deputy director of the National Housing Law Project (NHLP), told me. CPD also provides block grants to state and local governments affected by hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. Some of this support, known as RUSH funds, are meant to provide emergency shelter and rapid re-housing for people and families experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness in the wake of a natural disaster. The funds were created with $56 million in 2022, in the aftermath of Florida’s deadly Hurricane Ian, according to a 2023 report from the NLIHC and the NHLP. Last year, the funds helped support disaster recovery in the Carolinas following Hurricane Helene. “HUD plays a huge role in disaster relief,” Thrope said, “and oftentimes can be sort of the first tranche of assistance that families are eligible for.”  The targeted offices also play critical roles in supporting survivors of domestic violence, who can be at risk of or pushed into homelessness as a result of abuse. The Fair Housing Office is charged with enforcing the housing provisions of the Violence Against Women Act, which protects survivors’ rights to confidentiality and emergency transfers to escape abusers and prevents them from being discriminated against or evicted due to their status as a survivor. The thought of the HUD workers who provide these services being fired, Bergstresser said, “terrifies me.” “HUD is not the only one in our ecosystem that does the work, but I like to say we’re the ground floor of the house,” she added. “Without it, in a very short amount of time, everyone in our community will start to feel it.”  What does Trump have to say about all this? Nothing, so far. Spokespeople for the White House and HUD did not respond to questions from Mother Jones, and the president did not devote a single word in his Tuesday night speech to the joint session of Congress to the housing shortage or affordability crisis. Bergstresser, who attended as a guest of Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), was not “surprised, but of course, I’m disappointed.” HUD Secretary Turner’s confirmation had already raised alarm for housing advocates worried about his comments endorsing work requirements for federal housing assistance and advocating for more private equity involvement in the housing market. ProPublica reported that as a Texas legislator, Turner voted against legislation expanding affordable housing and support for unhoused people. But for now, he appears to be focusing his attention elsewhere. He reportedly invited Sean Feucht, a Christian nationalist, on a tour of the LA wildfire devastation to provide “Divine perspective” on how to rebuild.  On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that HUD plans to close dozens of field offices across the country—potentially in violation of federal law, which requires the agency to operate at least one field office in each state to process mortgage insurance applications. Thrope said this would also have a significant impact on the work of people like Bergstresser, who worked in HUD’s Boston field office: “They’re the ones reviewing complaints in their region and making sure that people’s fair housing rights are realized.”  Resistance to DOGE’s potential decimation of HUD is ramping up as details continue to leak out. Monday night, federal workers and lawmakers held a rally outside the HUD headquarters in DC to protest the planned firings. Hundreds of organizations from across the country have also signed a letter to leaders of Congress, which the NLIHC plans to send to lawmakers by next week, urging them to oppose further DOGE firings at HUD. “Rather than improving efficiency,” the letter says, “such drastic staffing cuts at HUD will cause significant, harmful, and costly delays and will worsen America’s affordable housing and homelessness crisis, as well as its significant disaster recovery needs.”  Yesterday’s #HandsOffHousing event was a resounding reminder that, collectively, we will push forward until the harmful threats against vital housing & homelessness programs are defeated!NLIHC thanks the congressional leaders, partners, & impacted people for their tireless work… pic.twitter.com/z5WbVsQdKZ The status of Bergstresser’s former job remains unclear after a federal judge last week ruled that the firings of probationary workers were probably illegal. This prompted the Trump administration earlier this week to issue revised guidance to agencies this week claiming that, in fact, it was not ordering them to fire probationary employees.  When we spoke on Wednesday morning, Bergstresser said the next steps were unclear, and she had not yet received an offer to return to her job. But if this happened, she said, “I’d take it.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Mother Jones,Trump Allies Are Deploying This “Book-Banning Pastor” to Local School Districts,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/trump-john-amanchukwu-book-banning-pastor-turning-point-usa-tour-school-district-board-meetings/,"John Amanchukwu speaks at a Turning Point USA event.Turning Point USA via YouTube  This story was originally published on the Popular Information substack, to which you can subscribe here. In a January 24 press release from the Department of Education, the Trump administration declared that book-banning was a “hoax.” But last month, President Donald Trump invited John Amanchukwu, the self-proclaimed “book-banning pastor,” to the White House for a Black History Month event. Since 2023, Amanchukwu, a youth pastor from North Carolina, has travelled to at least 23 school board meetings in 18 states on a nationwide book-banning tour financed by Trump donors and allies, including Turning Point USA (TPUSA). On this tour, Amanchukwu demands that school districts remove books that do not align with his conservative Christian ideology—usually books written by or about LGBTQ people. Amanchukwu relies heavily on insults and threats during his school board speeches, maximizing each appearance’s potential for social media virality. At a recent stop in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Amanchukwu launched into a typical rant about the book It Feels Good to Be Yourself. Amanchukwu said the book was “a lie” because it acknowledged that gender identity is fluid and intersex people exist. As proof that the book was lying to children, Amanchukwu cited Genesis 1:27. Informed by the chair of the school board that he was out of order because his comments did not pertain to items on the day’s agenda, Amanchukwu just began speaking louder, attempting to drown out the board members. Asked to return to his seat, Amanchukwu was undeterred. “We want to ban books that seek to pervert the hearts and minds of children,” he shouted. The shouting continued for approximately three minutes, until the board declared a recess. In April 2023, Amanchukwu attended a meeting of the Wake County Board of Education in his home state of North Carolina with then-candidate for state superintendent Michele Morrow and other local activists. In his comments (see video below), Amanchukwu said that inappropriate books were being “purchased and delivered” to local schools as part of a plot by the “Democrat Party” that “castrates children, mutilates children, perverts children, grooms children, murders children, and indoctrinates children.” (The Wake County Board of Education is nonpartisan.) At a July 18, 2023 meeting in Temecula, California, Amanchukwu described a textbook lesson about civil rights icon Harvey Milk as “filth.” In August 2023, Amanchukwu officially announced a nationwide tour of school boards in partnership with a “major organization,” TPUSA. In June 2024, he appeared on a podcast hosted by TPUSA Founder Charlie Kirk during which Amanchukwu revealed that TPUSA had chipped in “thousands and thousands” of dollars to support his work. Amanchukwu also said he received “hundreds of thousands” of dollars from Robert “Dr. Bob” Shillman. Shillman is a businessman and right-wing donor who has previously funded anti-muslim activists including Laura Loomer, Brigitte Gabriel, and Tommy Robinson. Shillman also hosted a fundraiser with JD Vance for the Trump campaign in September 2024. Some specifics of the financial arrangement between Amanchukwu, TPUSA, and Shillman have not been disclosed. But, based on TPUSA social media posts, it appears that Shillman’s donations to TPUSA are being used to fund Amanchukwu’s school board tour. Amanchukwu has worked with TPUSA Faith, an offshoot of TPUSA, as a contributor since July 2022. Amanchukwu was a featured speaker at America Fest, TPUSA’s annual conference, in December 2024 and is often featured on TPUSA’s social media accounts. TPUSA and Amanchukwu’s agent did not respond to requests for comment. In fall 2024, Amanchukwu became a visiting fellow at the Center for Renewing America, an organization founded by Russell Vought, a lead author of Project 2025 who was recently confirmed as Trump’s Director of the Office of Management and Budget. (The group did not respond to questions about Amanchukwu’s work.) At many school board meetings, Amanchukwu appears wearing hoodies emblazoned with his quotes from past meetings. These hoodies (see below) are available for purchase on his website, iknowgodmerch.com, for $60. (At the time of publication, Amanchukwu’s merch store was password protected.) Amanchukwu has also written two books, which he promotes frequently in podcast appearances. He released a film in October 2024 about his school board tour, which can be purchased for $9.99. The film, produced in partnership with TPUSA Faith, features other prominent right-wing figures, including billionaire and self-proclaimed historian David Barton. When Amanchukwu announced his school board tour, he said he would travel to the “wokest and bluest and darkest cities in America.” Instead, his tour has largely stopped in purple or red districts, including Boise, Idaho; Washoe County, Nevada; Gwinnett County, Georgia; and Midland, Texas. On at least two occasions when he visited school boards that only allow public comments from people residing in their district, Amanchukwu has claimed to be the roommate of a local activist. Amanchukwu’s school board speeches follow a routine format. He identifies a few books he feels do not belong in school libraries. These books often feature LGBTQ characters and range from picture books to more mature young-adult novels. Amanchukwu reads a passage from one of the more mature books and admonishes school board members for allowing such “perverse” material in their libraries. Amanchukwu frequently breaks meeting rules, which has resulted in him being escorted out of meetings by police on several occasions—and provides eye-catching content for his social media accounts. At a meeting of Florida’s Indian River County School Board in August 2023, Amanchukwu was escorted from the meeting by police because he continued reading from 13 Reasons Why by Jay Asher after the board asked him to stop. Amanchukwu and TPUSA have used footage of Amanchukwu being removed from this meeting to promote his school board tour and foster a narrative that Amanchukwu is being persecuted for his beliefs. At a school board meeting in New Jersey, Amanchukwu, who is Black, was asked to leave after using the n-word, but refused to leave the speaker’s podium for several minutes. He shouted to the school board that he would not leave because it was his “Rosa Parks moment.” He also compared himself to Rosa Parks on an episode of Kirk’s podcast. In Mesa, Arizona, Amanchukwu called school board members “racist bigots” for celebrating Black History Month when less than 5 percent of the student body is Black and for having a library book about a trans Black boy. Amanchukwu specifically called out the board’s only Black member, saying she should be “voted off first.” On podcasts, Amachukwu’s language is even more inflammatory and insulting—often directed at women and trans people. On an episode of Kirk’s podcast, Amanchukwu mocked a woman featured in a Planned Parenthood sex education video, saying she looked like a “two-liter bottle.” Amanchukwu said the video would deter students from having sex because they would be disgusted by the woman’s appearance. “I mean the last thing you want to think about is sex looking at that woman…” he said, “if it’s a woman.” In July 2024, Amanchukwu uploaded a video about his visit to a school board meeting in Washoe County, Nevada. In it, he spent several minutes attacking Debi Stears, the collections director for Washoe County libraries, and quoted a Bible verse implying it would be better for her to be killed than to continue providing books he deems inappropriate for children. “Debi, Debi, Debi, you don’t know what you’re doing,” Amanchukwu said. “Do you not know that the Bible tells us in Luke 17:2 ‘it is better for a man to be thrown into the sea with a millstone around his neck, than for someone to do harm to a child’?” In an episode of a conservative podcast on Rumble, a right-wing alternative to YouTube, Amanchukwu said that he would physically attack a transgender athlete—presumably a minor—if they were to compete against his young daughter. “I can only imagine myself being in the stands and seeing some hairy man walking out on the track or getting ready to jump in the pool to swim against my precious baby girl. Man, let me tell you something, it would be WWE Raw, because listen Brad, I’m just gonna be honest with you, you are not gonna disenfranchise and defraud my baby girl, alright. The way I love my daughter, no siree. I’m going on that track, I’m jumping in that pool, and we’re gonna fight it out. And by the time we’re done, no one’s gonna want to get in the pool because I have turned it upside down. I’m gonna turn green,” Amanchukwu said. “I’m not saying that I’m trying to promote people to violence, but I am saying I’m calling people to speak up and use their voice.” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Mother Jones,Elon Musk’s $1 Credit Card Spending Cap Is Paralyzing Federal Agencies,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/donald-trump-elon-musk-doge-credit-card-spending-limit-federal-agencies/,"Elon Musk departs a meeting with Senate Republicans outside the Senate Chamber of the Capitol Building in Washington, DC on Wednesday March 5, 2025. Aaron Schwartz/dpa/ZUMA  This story was originally published by WIRED and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Last month, the Trump administration placed a $1 spending limit on most government-issued credit cards that federal employees use to cover travel and work expenses. The impacts are already widely felt. At the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, scientists aren’t able to order equipment used to repair ships and radars. At the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), laboratories are experiencing delays in ordering basic supplies. At the National Park Service, employees are canceling trips to oversee crucial maintenance work. And at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), employees worry that mission-critical projects could be stalled. In many cases, employees are already unable to carry out the basic functions of their job. “The longer this disruption lasts, the more the system will break,” says a USDA official who was granted anonymity because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media about the looming crisis. This “felt like the rug was being pulled out from under us.” A researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) who tests new vaccines and treatments in rodents says he has had to put experiments on hold; his lab is not able to get certain necessary materials, such as antibodies, which are needed to assess immune response. “We have animals here that are aging that will pretty soon be too old to work with,” says the researcher, who requested anonymity as they aren’t authorized to speak publicly about the agency. Young mice and rats that are 6 to 8 weeks old are typically used for drug and vaccine studies, but some of the animals in their lab have now aged out of that window and may have to be euthanized.They say NIH workers have been using internal listservs to ask for reagents and lab equipment from other buildings or institutions to try to compensate for shortages, but they’re not always able to track down what they need. The NIH is made up of 27 institutes and centers, and its Bethesda, Maryland, campus is spread across more than 75 buildings. “Sometimes you need something that’s really niche, and you’re just not going to find it from someone else on campus,” they say. The change comes as Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency continues to hunt for alleged examples of waste across the federal government. Late last month, DOGE announced that it was working to “simplify” the government’s largest credit card program, which issues GSA SmartPay travel and purchase cards for federal employees. Last Wednesday, the agency claimed 24,000 cards had been deactivated. The credit card program allows federal workers to bypass the typical procurement process required to buy goods and services. A 2002 report from the Department of Commerce said that, “by avoiding the formal procurement process, GSA estimates the annual savings to be $1.2 billion.” It also enables federal employees to avoid paying sales tax on expenses that the government is exempt from. At the FDA, labs that analyze samples to ensure that food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics are safe and meet regulatory standards are already facing shortages. “While we are always acutely aware of when Congress’ funding is going to run out, we are able to order supplies to keep things going in the lab. This abrupt ending felt like the rug was being pulled out from under us,” says an employee at the FDA who requested anonymity because they aren’t authorized to speak with the media. The employee recently placed an order for pipette tips, an essential laboratory supply, but found that order was put on hold. “Now we are running out, asking colleagues at other offices to share what they might not be using,” they told WIRED. In addition, workers say FDA labs now have to go through a lengthy process to order liquid nitrogen, which is used to keep ultra-cold freezers running. These freezers preserve samples of cells and other biological material that reflect years, and sometimes decades, of research. Delays in getting liquid nitrogen tanks could destroy that material. Previously, new tanks could usually be acquired the same day as putting in a request. Now, it takes a week or so to receive a tank after initiating a request. An employee at the Environmental Protection Agency says her facility is not able to place regular orders of liquid nitrogen at the moment. “We have dozens of these freezers full of important environmental samples that are imminently at risk of being lost because we can no longer get our regular shipments of liquid nitrogen,” says the employee, who requested anonymity. These samples are used as part of research on detection and remediation methods for chemicals such as PFAS, which are found in many products and break down very slowly over time. “Scientists are being forced to jerry-rig the connection points on these freezers to accept pressures of liquid nitrogen they were not designed to handle,” the employee says. “Divisions are resorting to bartering with each other to obtain needed items.” “Instead of focusing on other work, I’m focused on three different contingencies on how to handle this.” The FDA and EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED. The credit card freeze also means that federal researchers who were working on scientific manuscripts can’t pay journal fees, meaning they can’t submit their work to certain journals for publication. An employee at a federal forensics lab told WIRED that spending limits mean the lab is no longer able to pay to ship evidence back to agents, effectively halting its ability to do casework. Before a case goes to trial, defendants have the right to access and review evidence that the prosecution intends to use against them, which includes access to the evidence in their case. Defendants are able to send that evidence to an outside lab for analysis if they choose. “Cases can’t progress until we return the evidence,” says the forensics lab worker, who asked to remain anonymous. “I basically can’t do my job right now.” NIH employees were told that travel cards could not be used at all for 30 days, forcing scientists to cancel plans to attend a major infectious disease conference next week. USDA employees at the Pest Identification Technology Laboratory have stockpiled reagents used for molecular tests in advance of the spending limits, according to the USDA official. FAA employees who travel to work on and test aviation systems worry the credit card freeze will prevent them from completing their projects. “We are allowed to use our personal cards in emergencies but none of us trust them to pay us back now,” says one employee. The impacts have hit the National Park Service as well. One employee was poised to go on a trip to oversee road maintenance at a national monument when the change went into effect on February 20. “Unless I want to pay for it myself, I can’t go. I can’t pay for my hotel, my rental car, fuel for the car. Now I can’t carry out the mission,” the employee says. “Today, instead of focusing on other work, I’m focused on three different contingencies on how to handle this. Do I go? Do I call my engineering team and tell them to reschedule? And if so, when? The project is on an indefinite hold.” A memo written to staff at the National Park Service specified that “all travel that is NOT related to national security, public safety, or immigration enforcement should be canceled if it begins on Wednesday, February 26, through the end of March 2025.” A long-term decision on the travel policy, it said, will come “at a later date.” Some NPS staffers were able to travel in February despite not getting official clearance. They have now been told no travel will be allowed in March. To date, roughly 75 trips have been canceled or rescheduled, according to a source familiar with the situation. The National Park Service did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Some government employees say they were given a warning prior to the change being announced on February 20. “We went out and bought cases and cases of toilet paper the night before,” another current employee at the National Park Service says. “There’s a general acknowledgement that things are going to break.” That employee works in the Pacific West Region, which manages federal land in California, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Nevada, as well as parks in Arizona, Montana, Guam, and American Samoa. While the GSA did allow for the possibility of exceptions to the clamp-down, the employee claims there are only four purchase cards with spending limits above $1 available for the entire region. Some of these parks pay for services like internet and wireless on purchase cards—leaving staffers wondering if their work devices could soon be cut off. “Before someone can fix a bathroom a work order has to be issued,” the current employee explains. “That happens electronically. Like any business, we rely on email, Teams, and chat to get things done.” The spending limits reflect Musk’s belief in zero-based budgeting. After he purchased Twitter, he slashed the budget to zero and forced employees to justify every expense. He also froze people’s corporate credit cards. “With the Twitter pausing of payments, at some point we were in a meeting at 1 am on a Saturday, and it was like, ‘Hey, let’s turn the credit cards off to see what bounces, and what happens,’” explained angel investor Jason Calacanis on the All In podcast in February. (Calacanis was part of Musk’s transition team at Twitter.) “And of course, we started getting calls … The people who come first, they’re probably the ones who are in on the biggest grift.” Employees see it a different way. “There are so many controls in place to make sure fraud doesn’t happen,” alleges the current NPS staffer. “I honestly believe the only fraud occurring is being committed by Musk, [Russell] Vought, and [Donald] Trump.” Kate Knibbs and Aarian Marshall contributed to this reporting.

Mother Jones,Private Prison Companies Set to Make Billions Reopening Jails for ICE,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/private-prison-mass-deportation-trump-billions-geogroup-corecivic-ice/,"In 2019, about 900 mothers and families were detained at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. It will be reopening with a 2,400-bed capacity under a new contract. Bob Daemmrich/ZUMA Wire  Late Wednesday afternoon, private prison company CoreCivic announced it would be reopening a notorious family detention center in South Texas, under an amended contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The facility, first built in 2014, will house up to 2,400 people, including children. It had been shut down last year to save costs, after years of reports suggesting poor treatment, including a report of one toddler who died due to a lack of medical care.  The reopening is part of a trend. CoreCivic isn’t the only company bringing back facilities. We are at the beginning of what looks like a private prison boom, as the groups profit off President Donald Trump’s plans for mass deportation. They are set to make billions. As the Washington Post reported, the GEO Group and CoreCivic stand to benefit in particular from Trump’s immigration plans—the companies hold at least 16 vacant facilities that can be reopened within months for mass detention and deportation.  The GEO Group announced in late February that it would be reopening Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey, as a “massive” immigration detention center with 1,000 beds. In California, ICE is considering repurposing and reopening the women’s prison FCI Dublin, closed last year due to mass sexual abuse, for immigrant detention. In Baldwin, Michigan, ICE and the GEO Group have expressed interest in reopening North Lake Correctional Facility, a former private prison shuttered in 2022. (A Biden administration order directed the Department of Justice to allow contracts with private prison groups to expire.) In Leavenworth, Kansas, CoreCivic looks likely to partner with ICE to reopen yet another shuttered private prison, documents obtained by the ACLU revealed. As of February 27, ICE held 43,759 detainees, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonpartisan data-gathering organization. Trump is putting pressure on ICE to increase the number of arrests per day. His administration has already fired one ICE director, ostensibly for not deporting enough people. In the communities surrounding these new jails for migrants, activists and politicians are fighting back. In Newark, where the GEO Group stands to make $1.2 billion by reopening Delaney Hall, the immigrant rights organization Make the Road is planning a rally against the jail March 11.  “The reopening of Delaney Hall will mean heightened ICE presence and arrests in New Jersey,” said Eliana Fernandez, Make the Road’s organizing director. In 2017, when the detention center was last operational, its private management came under fire for physical and sexual abuse of detainees. To Fernandez, this is a cash grab by the GEO Group, benefiting from the suffering of immigrants. “There’s a private interest behind the detention and the incarceration of our community…but we have been through this road before, and we have made it to the other side.”  It’s also not clear whether the reopening of places like Delaney Hall would be entirely legal. In 2021, New Jersey passed a law banning private detention facilities. CoreCivic sued over its own facility in the state and won the right to operate. Still, on the city level, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka threatened to issue a stop-work order on Delaney Hall.  “The reality is, they have to go through the permitting process,” Baraka said this week. “They don’t go through that, then the building can’t be opened. We’re going to go over there in the next couple of days and probably do a stop-work order to shut the building down until they finish getting permits.”   Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

There may be conflicting opinions about aspects of the first-Thanksgiving story or the latest political news.

Indonesia has deployed a new weapon against the rising threat of wildfires. It’s called the Power of Mama. Women in the group walk among local fields and villages to help encourage farmers to follow laws and common-sense practices that reduce risk. In other words, they play mother, encouraging people to do the right thing.Our story today is testament to a fact the world could perhaps better embrace – that among the most powerful agents for positive change is mother love.     Discover the values that drive the story. The Christian Science Monitor's coverage of the war between Hamas and Israel, and related articles. A deeper view that unites instead of divides, connecting why the story matters to you. The Christian Science Monitor is an international news organization offering calm, thoughtful, award-winning coverage for independent thinkers. We tackle difficult conversations and divisive issues – we don’t shy away from hard problems. But you’ll find in each Monitor news story qualities that can lead to solutions and unite us – qualities such as respect, resilience, hope, and fairness. The Monitor's global, value-based approach is reflected in how Mary Baker Eddy, who founded this newspaper in 1908, described its purpose: ""To injure no man, but to bless all mankind."" Our aim is to embrace the human family. We prize honesty and largeness of heart. We seek practical solutions, not just page views. Also, by focusing on the values behind the news, we offer a deeper view – a read more about solutions that unite rather than divide. That’s why many of our stories clearly identify the values driving the news – whether it’s respect, compassion, responsibility, freedom, or so on. Doing this tells why the story itself really matters – it gets to the heart of what people and societies are wrestling with. But it also better explains why the story matters to you – showing how all news, local or not, has a universal relevance.  We are an independent voice, without the corporate allegiances and pressures that too often skew today's media. We offer readers the information they need to come to their own constructive conclusions. For more information, see our FAQ section below.  ""The Monitor is a trustworthy news source, based on a foundation of solid ethics and a public service mission,"" according to an audit by Trusting News.  We deliver global news via our website and mobile site, daily newsletter, weekly print magazine, and free newsletters. When first published in 1908, the Monitor was described by its editor-in-chief as journalism “to appeal to good men and women everywhere who are interested in the betterment of all human conditions and the moral and spiritual advancement of the race.” For more than a century, our aim has been to cover the news of the day with honesty and integrity. In addition to our daily news coverage, the Monitor publishes one religious article each weekday in the Christian Science Perspective column. These commentaries offer spiritual insights on contemporary issues, including the news. Our name is about honesty. The Monitor is owned by The Christian Science Church, and we’ve always been transparent about that. The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. The Monitor aims to be a newspaper welcomed in any home. Its name clearly identifies it as providing journalism based on progress, integrity, impartiality, and unselfish love – all of which are fundamental values of Christian Science. Not all Monitor staff are Christian Scientists, but all are committed to these journalistic goals.  The Monitor is committed to delivering news that is factual. Our bias is to present the world through a lens that is calm and measured, as well as characterized by honesty, fairness, compassion, and respect. We dare to see the world differently, but not by ignoring the challenges the world faces. The Christian Science Monitor is one of five ongoing publications produced by The Christian Science Publishing Society, the publishing activity of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston.  The Monitor is funded by revenue from subscriptions, an endowment fund, donations, gifts, and profits from the Publishing Society. The Monitor also accepts outside grants to support general operations, special projects, and coverage of specific topics of interest to our readers, but we do this without giving up our editorial independence. Additional funding to cover operating costs is provided by The First Church of Christ, Scientist. The Monitor is a gift that offers evidence of humanity’s progress.

Without trust, suspicion begets friction, division, and immobility. Today, too many realms are seeing trust deficits grow: between citizens, across racial lines, in government. This special project explores through global news stories how polarized parties are navigating times of mistrust and how we can learn to build trust in each other. Climate change is shaping a mindset revolution—powerfully driving innovation and progress. And young people are leading the transformation. This special series focuses on the roles of those born since 1989, when recognition of children's rights and the spike of global temperatures began to intersect. The stories include vivid Monitor photography, and are written from Indigenous Northern Canada, Bangladesh, Namibia, Barbados, and the United States.

The Christian Science Monitor,About us,https://www.csmonitor.com/about,"Our name is about honesty. The Monitor is owned by The Christian Science Church, and we’ve always been transparent about that. The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. A deeper view that unites instead of divides, connecting why the story matters to you. Behind the news are values that drive people and nations. Explore them here.         
Indonesia has deployed a new weapon against the rising threat of wildfires. It’s called the Power of Mama. Women in the group walk among local fields and villages to help encourage farmers to follow laws and common-sense practices that reduce risk. In other words, they play mother, encouraging people to do the right thing.Our story today is testament to a fact the world could perhaps better embrace – that among the most powerful agents for positive change is mother love.     Discover the values that drive the story. The Christian Science Monitor's coverage of the war between Hamas and Israel, and related articles. A deeper view that unites instead of divides, connecting why the story matters to you. The Christian Science Monitor is an international news organization offering calm, thoughtful, award-winning coverage for independent thinkers. We tackle difficult conversations and divisive issues – we don’t shy away from hard problems. But you’ll find in each Monitor news story qualities that can lead to solutions and unite us – qualities such as respect, resilience, hope, and fairness. The Monitor's global, value-based approach is reflected in how Mary Baker Eddy, who founded this newspaper in 1908, described its purpose: ""To injure no man, but to bless all mankind."" Our aim is to embrace the human family. We prize honesty and largeness of heart. We seek practical solutions, not just page views. Also, by focusing on the values behind the news, we offer a deeper view – a read more about solutions that unite rather than divide. That’s why many of our stories clearly identify the values driving the news – whether it’s respect, compassion, responsibility, freedom, or so on. Doing this tells why the story itself really matters – it gets to the heart of what people and societies are wrestling with. But it also better explains why the story matters to you – showing how all news, local or not, has a universal relevance.  We are an independent voice, without the corporate allegiances and pressures that too often skew today's media. We offer readers the information they need to come to their own constructive conclusions. For more information, see our FAQ section below.  ""The Monitor is a trustworthy news source, based on a foundation of solid ethics and a public service mission,"" according to an audit by Trusting News.  We deliver global news via our website and mobile site, daily newsletter, weekly print magazine, and free newsletters. When first published in 1908, the Monitor was described by its editor-in-chief as journalism “to appeal to good men and women everywhere who are interested in the betterment of all human conditions and the moral and spiritual advancement of the race.” For more than a century, our aim has been to cover the news of the day with honesty and integrity. In addition to our daily news coverage, the Monitor publishes one religious article each weekday in the Christian Science Perspective column. These commentaries offer spiritual insights on contemporary issues, including the news. Our name is about honesty. The Monitor is owned by The Christian Science Church, and we’ve always been transparent about that. The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. The Monitor aims to be a newspaper welcomed in any home. Its name clearly identifies it as providing journalism based on progress, integrity, impartiality, and unselfish love – all of which are fundamental values of Christian Science. Not all Monitor staff are Christian Scientists, but all are committed to these journalistic goals.  The Monitor is committed to delivering news that is factual. Our bias is to present the world through a lens that is calm and measured, as well as characterized by honesty, fairness, compassion, and respect. We dare to see the world differently, but not by ignoring the challenges the world faces. The Christian Science Monitor is one of five ongoing publications produced by The Christian Science Publishing Society, the publishing activity of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston.  The Monitor is funded by revenue from subscriptions, an endowment fund, donations, gifts, and profits from the Publishing Society. The Monitor also accepts outside grants to support general operations, special projects, and coverage of specific topics of interest to our readers, but we do this without giving up our editorial independence. Additional funding to cover operating costs is provided by The First Church of Christ, Scientist. The Monitor is a gift that offers evidence of humanity’s progress.

The Washington Examiner,Washington Examiner,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/,"Children should be taught to love America. This does not mean whitewashing the grievous stain of slavery on our history but does mean eliminating propaganda suggesting ours is a fundamentally bad country. We need to foster a shared American culture based on dignity and respect for all, which means protecting minorities but also governing with policies most people want. Group should not be set against group. Today’s radicals aim to divide us. We cannot let them succeed. Individual responsibility is life affirming. Collectivism and dependency encourage debilitating helplessness and a belief that government should fix all our problems. Government should get out of the way. People with new ideas need space to flourish. Red tape must be cut. The Bill of Rights must be defended, differences tolerated, cancel culture rejected. Freedom of conscience, religion, and association must be protected. American global leadership must be maintained; the world is better for it. U.S. leadership cannot exist only in theory but must be exercised in practice, which requires Washington to use national strength and moral suasion confidently in every multilateral organization. Our military’s only purpose is to win wars or deter them with the potency of its weapons, training, and tactics. A strong military is also non-political; it must cease being used for social experimentation and espousing corrosive dogma that sows division and self-doubt. Our deepening debt militates against our global power. American leadership needs a balanced economy that encourages wealth creation. The silent majority must speak its mind and no longer shrug off what seems to be “just politics.” This means rejecting bullying on race, class, and gender. America has become increasingly stratified, with some people elevated and deferred to improperly, while others are denigrated or ignored. This is not what America is supposed to be. It was founded on the belief that ordinary adults should have an equal say about how they are governed and by whom. Equality does not delegate democratic authority to experts, removing it from those whom voters have chosen to do that job. This must remain a country that rejects princes or potentates. It must be a country of laws. Equality before the law should be the only enforced equality. True equality also means respecting life, supporting the most vulnerable among us, including those unborn and those in decline at the end of their lives. The inegalitarian assertion that vulnerable people have less claim to society’s protection amounts to the tyrannical idea that might makes right. There is an active effort to dismantle the traditional family. Black Lives Matter, a Marxist organization embraced by gentry liberals, says the traditional family is a racist institution. In truth it is the most effective social, cultural, educational, and healthcare institution of all. The Washington Examiner will support policies that foster family formation and parental authority, which promote freedom and resist central control. Decisions should be left whenever possible to authorities closest to the people governed by them. Charities, community groups, churches, towns, counties, and states should shoulder most responsibilities, as the Constitution either prescribes or implies. Efforts by the federal government to arrogate states’ rights should be fought back. Increasingly, people are condemned based on accusations alone, without evidence or the right of reply. Fairness and justice demand due process. They also demand appropriate law enforcement, which requires supporting police forces with proper funding and training. Sanctuary cities, vandalism, and all forms of violence must be opposed. The law must be respected, and Political and civic authorities should demonstrate high standards of public behavior. The electoral foundation of our democracy, which is also the foundation of our laws, must also be fair; this means protecting election integrity with voter ID. For a society to evolve and yet to be stable and tolerant, it must always be engaged in a negotiation between past and future, respecting the wisdom of the former while not snuffing out the hopes of the latter.",child taught love america mean whitewashing grievous stain slavery history mean eliminating propaganda suggesting fundamentally bad country need foster shared american culture based dignity respect mean protecting minority also governing policy people want group set group today radical aim divide u let succeed individual responsibility life affirming collectivism dependency encourage debilitating helplessness belief government fix problem government get way people new idea need space flourish red tape must cut bill right must defended difference tolerated cancel culture rejected freedom conscience religion association must protected american global leadership must maintained world better leadership exist theory must exercised practice requires washington use national strength moral suasion confidently every multilateral organization military purpose win war deter potency weapon training tactic strong military also non political must cease used social experimentation espousing corrosive dogma sow division self doubt deepening debt militates global power american leadership need balanced economy encourages wealth creation silent majority must speak mind longer shrug seems politics mean rejecting bullying race class gender america become increasingly stratified people elevated deferred improperly others denigrated ignored america supposed founded belief ordinary adult equal say governed equality delegate democratic authority expert removing voter chosen job must remain country reject prince potentate must country law equality law enforced equality true equality also mean respecting life supporting vulnerable among u including unborn decline end life inegalitarian assertion vulnerable people less claim society protection amount tyrannical idea might make right active effort dismantle traditional family black life matter marxist organization embraced gentry liberal say traditional family racist institution truth effective social cultural educational healthcare institution washington examiner support policy foster family formation parental authority promote freedom resist central control decision left whenever possible authority closest people governed charity community group church town county state shoulder responsibility constitution either prescribes implies effort federal government arrogate state right fought back increasingly people condemned based accusation alone without evidence right reply fairness justice demand due process also demand appropriate law enforcement requires supporting police force proper funding training sanctuary city vandalism form violence must opposed law must respected political civic authority demonstrate high standard public behavior electoral foundation democracy also foundation law must also fair mean protecting election integrity voter id society evolve yet stable tolerant must always engaged negotiation past future respecting wisdom former snuffing hope latter,washington examiner,Left,146.1959,Far Authoritarian,257.24426,Far Authoritarian Left

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight. Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				 We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				 We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				 One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				 Help us save her. A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				 Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				 Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				 We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				 Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				 In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.
				 Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters 
					and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.
				 We can save America together. Become a Daily Caller Patriot today. Neil Patel Internal promotions, affiliate content, recommended content and spam will be embedded in their paid

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight. Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and 
					joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes 
					to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; 
					senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want 
					to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our 
					independence.
				 We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our 
					hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.
				 We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. 
					Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates 
					them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.
				 One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of 
					our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.
				 Help us save her. A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have 
					trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political 
					spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily 
					Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, 
					Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.
				 Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a 
					fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.
				 Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. 
					And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible 
					to ignore.
				 We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — 
					the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.
				 Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, 
					corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new 
					generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there 
					are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.
				 In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that 
					we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need 
					revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent 
					we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and 
					lightning fast website you deserve.

Mr Khamenei accused America of imposing new demands on Iran’s missile programme. During his first term America’s president abandoned a nuclear pact with Iran, which he said was too generous, but failed to secure a stricter agreement.
